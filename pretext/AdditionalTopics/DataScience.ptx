  <title>Data Science</title>

  <p>Data science is a multidisciplinary field which combines computer science,
    math, and other domains to answer questions using data.</p>

  <p>As the world moves more and more towards storing and analyzing large amounts of data,
    data science is a vital skill for you to be familiar with, whether you're a computer science major or not. It is also 
	a very common and useful application of programming, which is why we're discussing it in this class.</p>

  <p>Data science is perhaps best defined by describing what data science looks like. <term>The data science process</term> consists of four steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Obtaining data</li>
    <li>Cleaning the data</li>
    <li>Exploring the data</li>
    <li>Predicting unknowns</li>
  </ol>

  <p><term>Obtaining the data</term>: We live in a time where data is more abundant then ever before. Getting a hold of data can involve gathering it yourself,
  purchasing it, or taking advantage of the many, many sites online now which have a plethora of data 
  available for free (and sometimes paid) use. if you are getting your data from some 3rd party, it will likely come in a .csv, .json, or SQL database format.</p>

  <p><term>Cleaning the data</term>: This can vary, but ultimately you need to prepare your data
    in a way that makes it easily usable in the next steps. Often data starts out "noisy" or contains errors. In this step you may
    fix things in the data, change missing data, or correct wrong data.</p>

  <p>Cleaning is regularly considered the longest step in this process! Data can come in all sorts of different
    formats now, with anomalies, with blanks, and so much more. It often depends on context and you own goals 
	what "fixing" data even means.</p>

  <p><term>Exploring the data</term>: Now that the data is prepared, we can do some analysis on it! As the term suggests, exploring the data is about coming to better
  understand it. You often don't know what is interesting or useful about data when you first encounter it. You may need to do some sort of statistical
    analysis to uncover the interesting aspects, or you may want to graph values and look for relationships and trends visually.</p>

  <p><term>Predicting unknowns</term>: Having come to understand the data better, you can now use it to create new knowledge. These days, this step typically involves 
    using machine learning models. These techniques can generally be split into three groups:</p>
	
  <ol>
    <li><term>Supervised Learning</term>: With supervised learning, we try to construct a model that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs (regularly 
	referred to as "labels"). Knowing what labels we want in advance is what makes a method "supervised". For example, we could create a model to guess when an email 
	is spam or not based on its contents; the label here is "spam" or "not spam". Or we could try to guess what the stock price will be for our favorite company based 
	on how it has performed in the last few weeks. The label here would be the predicted stock price.</li>
    <li><term>Unsupervised Learning</term>: Contrasting with supervised learning, with unsupervised learning we don't know the labels in advance. An example here could be
	using social media data to automatically identify friend groups. We don't know in advance how many groups we'll find or what their nature will be. Because of this, it
	can be harder to guess what kind of results unsupervised learning will produce.</li>
    <li><term>Semi-Supervised Learning:</term> Semi-supervised learning is an attempt to capture the best aspects of both supervised and unsupervised learning. With these
	approaches we start with some data that has labels and also some data that doesn't. To use a previous example, we could take a collection of emails, only some of 
	which have been labeled as spam or not, and still try to construct a reliable method for identifying new emails as spam. If it goes well, then we've saved ourselves 
	a lot of time that would have otherwise been spent labeling emails.</li>
  </ol>
