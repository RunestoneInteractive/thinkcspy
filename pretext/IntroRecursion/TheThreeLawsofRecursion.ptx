    <title>The Three Laws of Recursion</title>
    <p>Like the robots of Asimov, all recursive algorithms must obey three
            important laws:</p>
    <p>
        <ol label="1">
            <li>
                <p>
                    A recursive algorithm must have a
                    <alert>base case</alert>
                    .
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base
                    case.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let&#8217;s look at each one of these laws in more detail and see how it was
            used in the
        <c>listsum</c>
        algorithm. First, a base case is the condition
            that allows the algorithm to stop recursing. A base case is typically a
            problem that is small enough to solve directly. In the
        <c>listsum</c>
        algorithm the base case is a list of length 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        To obey the second law, we must arrange for a change of state that moves
            the algorithm toward the base case. A change of state means that some
            data that the algorithm is using is modified. Usually the data that
            represents our problem gets smaller in some way. In the
        <c>listsum</c>
        algorithm our primary data structure is a list, so we must focus our
            state-changing efforts on the list. Since the base case is a list of
            length 1, a natural progression toward the base case is to shorten the
            list. This is exactly what happens on line 5 of
        <xref ref="intro_recursion_calculating-the-sum-of-a-list-of-numbers" />
        when we call
        <c>listsum</c>
        with a shorter list.
    </p>
    <p>The final law is that the algorithm must call itself. This is the very
            definition of recursion. Recursion is a confusing concept to many
            beginning programmers. As a novice programmer, you have learned that
            functions are good because you can take a large problem and break it up
            into smaller problems. The smaller problems can be solved by writing a
            function to solve each problem. When we talk about recursion it may seem
            that we are talking ourselves in circles. We have a problem to solve
            with a function, but that function solves the problem by calling itself!
            But the logic is not circular at all; the logic of recursion is an
            elegant expression of solving a problem by breaking it down into a
            smaller and easier problems.</p>
    <p>In the remainder of this chapter we will look at more examples of
            recursion. In each case we will focus on designing a solution to a
            problem by using the three laws of recursion.</p>

                    There are only five numbers on the list, the number of recursive calls will not be greater than the size of the list.

                    The initial call to listsum is not a recursive call.

                    the first recursive call passes the list [4,6,8,10], the second [6,8,10] and so on until [10].

            <statement>

                <p>Suppose you are going to write a recusive function to calculate the factorial of a number.  fact(n) returns n * n-1 * n-2 * &#8230; * 1, and the factorial of zero is definded to be 1.  What would be the most appropriate base case?</p>

                    <feedback>
                    Although this would work there are better and slightly more efficient choices. since fact(1) and fact(0) are the same.

                    <feedback>
                    A good choice, but what happens if you call fact(0)?
                </feedback>
                </choice>

                <choice>

                    <feedback>
                    This basecase would be true for all numbers greater than zero so fact of any positive number would be 1.
                </feedback>
                </choice>

                <choice correct="yes">

                        <p>n &lt;= 1</p>

                    <feedback>
                    Good, this is the most efficient, and even keeps your program from crashing if you try to compute the factorial of a negative number.
                </feedback>
