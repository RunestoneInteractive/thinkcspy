  <title>Runetime Stack and <c>raise</c> command</title>
  <p>There are cases where the sequential flow-of-control does
            not work well. An example will best explain this.</p>
  <p>Let's suppose that a program contains complex logic that is appropriately
            subdivided into functions. The program is running and it currently is executing
            function D, which was called by function C, which was called by function B,
            which was called by function A, which was called from the main function. This
            is illustrated by the following simplistic code example:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
def main()
  A()

def A():
  B()

def B():
  C()

def C():
  D()

def D()
  # processing
</code>
  </program>
  <p>Function D determines that the current processing won't work for some reason
            and needs to send a message to the main function to try something different.
            However, all that function D can do using normal flow-of-control is to return
            a value to function C. So function D returns a special value to function C
            that means <q>try something else</q>. Function C has to recognize this value,
            quit its processing, and return the special value to function B. And so forth
            and so on. It would be very helpful if function D could communicate directly
            with the main function (or functions A and B) without sending a special value
            through the intermediate calling functions. Well, that is exactly what an
            <em>exception</em> does. An <em>exception</em> is a message to any function currently on the
            executing program's <q>run-time-stack</q>. (The <q>run-time-stack</q> is what keeps track
            of the active function calls while a program is executing.)</p>
  <p>In Python, your create an <em>exception</em> message using the <c>raise</c> command. The
            simplest format for a <c>raise</c> command is the keyword <c>raise</c> followed by
            the name of an exception. For example:</p>
  <program language="Python">
    <code>
raise ExceptionName
</code>
  </program>
  <p>So what happens to an <em>exception</em> message after it is created? The normal
            flow-of-control of a Python program is interrupted and Python starts looking
            for any code in its run-time-stack that is interested in dealing with the
            message. It always searches from its current location at the bottom of the
            run-time-stack, up the stack, in the order the functions were originally
            called. A <c>try: except:</c> block is used to say <q>hey,
            I can deal with that message.</q> The first <c>try: except:</c> block that Python
            finds on its search back up the run-time-stack will be executed. If there
            is no <c>try: except:</c> block found, the program <q>crashes</q> and prints its
            run-time-stack to the console.</p>
  <p>Let's take a look at several code examples to illustrate this process. If
            function D had a <c>try: except:</c> block around the code that <c>raised</c> a
            <c>MyException</c> message, then the flow-of-control would be passed to the
            local <c>except</c> block. That is, function D would handle it's own issues.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
def main()
  A()

def A():
  B()

def B():
  C()

def C():
  D()

def D()
  try:
    # processing code
    if something_special_happened:
      raise MyException
  except MyException:
    # execute if the MyException message happened
</code>
  </program>
  <p>But perhaps function C is better able to handle the issue, so you could put
            the <c>try: except:</c> block in function C:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
def main()
  A()

def A():
  B()

def B():
  C()

def C():
  try:
    D()
  except MyException:
    # execute if the MyException message happened

def D()
  # processing code
  if something_special_happened:
    raise MyException
</code>
  </program>
  <p>But perhaps the main function is better able to handle the issue, so you
            could put the <c>try: except:</c> block in the main function:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
def main()
  try:
    A()
  except MyException:
    # execute if the MyException message happened

def A():
  B()

def B():
  C()

def C():
  D()

def D()
  # processing code
  if something_special_happened:
    raise MyException
</code>
  </program>
