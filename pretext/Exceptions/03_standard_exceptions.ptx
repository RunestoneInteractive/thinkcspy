  <p>Most of the standard <em>exceptions</em> built into Python are listed below.
            They are organized into related groups based on the types of issues they deal with.</p>

  <p>All exceptions are objects. The classes that define the objects are organized
            in a hierarchy, which is shown below. This is important because the parent
            class of a set of related exceptions will catch all exception messages for
            itself and its child exceptions. For example, an <c>ArithmeticError</c>
            exception will catch itself and all <c>FloatingPointError</c>, <c>OverflowError</c>,
            and <c>ZeroDivisionError</c> exceptions.</p>
