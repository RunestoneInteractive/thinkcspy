  <title>The <c>finally</c> clause of the <c>try</c> statement</title>
  <p>A common programming pattern is to grab a resource of some kind &#x2014; e.g. we
            create a window for turtles to draw on, or we dial up a connection to our
            internet service provider, or we may open a file for writing. Then we perform
            some computation which may raise an exception, or may work without any
            problems.</p>
  <p>Whatever happens, we want to <q>clean up</q> the resources we grabbed &#x2014; e.g. close
            the window, disconnect our dial-up connection, or close the file. The <c>finally</c>
            clause of the <c>try</c> statement is the way to do just this. Consider this
            (somewhat contrived) example:</p>
  <program xml:id="ch13_7_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import turtle
import time

def show_poly():
  try:
    win = turtle.Screen()   # Grab/create a resource, e.g. a window
    tess = turtle.Turtle()

    # This dialog could be cancelled,
    #   or the conversion to int might fail, or n might be zero.
    n = int(input("How many sides do you want in your polygon?"))
    angle = 360 / n
    for i in range(n):      # Draw the polygon
        tess.forward(35)
        tess.left(angle)
    time.sleep(3)           # Make program wait a few seconds
  except Exception as e:
    print("insufficient number of sides")
    print(e)
  finally:
    win.bye()               # Close the turtle's window

show_poly()
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In lines 20&#x2013;22, <c>show_poly</c> is called three times. Each one creates a new
            window for its turtle, and draws a polygon with the number of sides input by
            the user. But what if the user enters a string that cannot be converted to
            an <c>int</c>? What if they close the dialog? We'll get an exception, <em>but even though
                we've had an exception, we still want to close the turtle's window</em>. Lines 17&#x2013;18
            does this for us. Whether we complete the statements in the <c>try</c> clause successfully
            or not, the <c>finally</c> block will always be executed.</p>
  <p>Notice that the exception is still unhandled &#x2014; only an <c>except</c> clause can
            handle an exception, so our program will still crash. But at least its turtle
            window will be closed before it crashes!</p>
