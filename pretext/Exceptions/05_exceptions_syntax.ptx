  <title>Exceptions Syntax</title>
  <subsection><title>Introduction</title>
  <p>There are many variations on the code that catches exceptions. Here is a
            brief summary, but other code variations are possible.</p>
        </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="exceptions_catch-all-exceptions">
    <title>Catch All Exceptions</title>
    <p>Catch all exceptions, regardless of their type. This will prevent
                your program from crashing, but this type of exception handling is rarely useful
                because you can't do anything meaningful to recover from the abnormal condition.</p>
    <program language="Python">
      <code>
try:
  # Your normal code goes here.
  # Your code should include function calls which might raise exceptions.
except:
  # If any exception was raised, then execute this code block.
</code>
    </program>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="exceptions_catch-a-specific-exception">
    <title>Catch A Specific Exception</title>
    <p>This is perhaps the most often used syntax. It catches one specific condition
                and tries to re-cover from the condition.</p>
    <program language="Python">
      <code>
try:
  # Your normal code goes here.
  # Your code should include function calls which might raise exceptions.
except ExceptionName:
  # If ExceptionName was raised, then execute this block.
</code>
    </program>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="exceptions_catch-multiple-specific-exceptions">
    <title>Catch Multiple Specific Exceptions</title>
    <program language="Python">
      <code>
try:
  # Your normal code goes here.
  # Your code should include function calls which might raise exceptions.
except Exception_one:
  # If Exception_one was raised, then execute this block.
except Exception_two:
  # If Exception_two was raised, then execute this block.
else:
  # If there was no exception then execute this block.
</code>
    </program>

  <subsection xml:id="exceptions_clean-up-after-exceptions">
    <title>Clean-up After Exceptions</title>
    <p>If you have code that you want to be executed even if exceptions occur, you
                can include a <c>finally</c> code block:</p>
    <program language="Python">
      <code>
try:
  # Your normal code goes here.
  # Your code might include function calls which might raise exceptions.
  # If an exception is raised, some of these statements might not be executed.
finally:
  # This block of code will always execute, even if there are exceptions raised
</code>
    </program>

  <subsection xml:id="exceptions_an-example-of-file-i-o">
    <title>An Example of File I/O</title>
    <p>One place where you will always want to include exception handling is when
                you read or write to a file. Here is a typical example of file processing.
                Note that the outer <c>try: except:</c> block takes care of a missing file or
                the fact that the existing file can't be opened for writing. The inner
                <c>try: except:</c> block  protects against output errors, such as trying to
                write to a device that is full. The <c>finally</c> code guarantees that the
                file is closed properly, even if there are errors during writing.</p>
    <program language="Python">
      <code>
try:
   f = open("my_file.txt", "w")
   try:
      f.write("Writing some data to the file")
   finally:
      f.close()
except IOError:
   print "Error: my_file.txt does not exist or it can't be opened for output."
</code>
    </program>
