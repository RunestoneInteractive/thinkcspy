  <title>Traversal and the <c>for</c> Loop: By Index</title>
  <p>It is also possible to use the <c>range</c> function to systematically generate the indices of the characters.  The <c>for</c> loop can then be used to iterate over these positions.
            These positions can be used together with the indexing operator to access the individual
            characters in the string.</p>
  <p>Consider the following codelens example.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch08_7" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
fruit = "apple"
for idx in range(5):
    currentChar = fruit[idx]
    print(currentChar)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>The index positions in <q>apple</q> are 0,1,2,3 and 4.  This is exactly the same sequence of integers returned by <c>range(5)</c>.  The first time through the for loop, <c>idx</c> will be 0 and the <q>a</q> will be printed.  Then, <c>idx</c> will be reassigned to 1 and <q>p</q> will be displayed.  This will repeat for all the range values up to but not including 5.  Since <q>e</q> has index 4, this will be exactly right to show all
            of the characters.</p>
  <p>In order to make the iteration more general, we can use the <c>len</c> function to provide the bound for <c>range</c>.  This is a very common pattern for traversing any sequence by position.        Make sure you understand why the range function behaves
            correctly when using <c>len</c> of the string as its parameter value.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch08_7b" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
fruit = "apple"
for idx in range(len(fruit)):
    print(fruit[idx])
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>You may also note that iteration by position allows the programmer to control the direction of the
            traversal by changing the sequence of index values.  Recall that we can create ranges that count down as
            well as up so the following code will print the characters from right to left.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch08_8" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
          fruit = "apple"
          for idx in range(len(fruit)-1, -1, -1):
              print(fruit[idx])
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>Trace the values of <c>idx</c> and satisfy yourself that they are correct.  In particular, note the start and end of the range.</p>

                    Yes, it will print all the characters in even index positions and the o character appears both times in an even location.
