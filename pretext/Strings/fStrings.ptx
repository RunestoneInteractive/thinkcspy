  <title>F-Strings</title>
  <introduction>
	<p>In grade school quizzes a common convention is to use fill-in-the blanks. For instance,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello _____!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and you can fill in the name of the person greeted, and combine
                given text with a chosen insertion. <em>We use this as an analogy:</em>
                Python has a similar
                construction, called a formatted string or an <b>f-string</b>. An f-string makes
                substitutions into places in a string
                enclosed in braces. Run this code:</p>
  </introduction>
    
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
person = input('Your name: ')
greeting = f'Hello {person}!'
print(greeting)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>There are several new ideas here!</p>
    <p>The string has been formatted in a new way. We have included an <c>f</c> before the starting quotation mark.
                Such a string is called an <i>f-string</i>.  Places where
                braces are embedded are replaced by the value of the expression inside the braces. There are many
                variations on the syntax between the braces. In this case we use
                the syntax where the first (and only) location in the string with
                braces has the variable <c>person</c>. When this code is evaluated, the value of the person variable is placed in the string in this location.</p>
    <p>In the code above, this new string is assigned to the identifier
                <c>greeting</c>, and then the string is printed.</p>
    <p>The identifier
                <c>greeting</c> was introduced to break the operations into a clearer
                sequence of steps. However, since the value of <c>greeting</c> is only
                referenced once, it can be eliminated with the more concise
                version:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
person = input('Enter your name: ')
print(f'Hello {person}!')
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>There can be multiple substitutions, with data of any type.
                Next we use floats.  Try original price $2.50  with a 7% discount:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = f'${origPrice} discounted by {discount}% is ${newPrice}.'
print(calculation)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>If you used the data suggested, this result is not satisfying.
                Prices should appear with exactly two places beyond the decimal point,
                but that is not the default way to display floats.</p>
    <p>F-strings can give further information inside the braces
                showing how to specially format data.
                In particular, floats can be shown with a specific number of decimal places.
                For two decimal places, put <c>:.2f</c> inside the braces but after the variable name for the monetary values:</p>
    <program xml:id="ch08_methods6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
calculation = f'${origPrice:.2f} discounted by {discount}% is ${newPrice:.2f}.'
print(calculation)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>The 2 in the format modifier can be replaced by another integer to round to that
                specified number of digits.</p>
    <p>A technical point: Since braces have special meaning in a format
                string, there must be a special rule if you want braces to actually
                be included in the final <em>formatted</em> string. The rule is to double
                the braces: <c>{ {</c> and <c>}}</c>. For example mathematical set
                notation uses braces. The initial and final doubled
                braces in the format string below generate literal braces in the
                formatted string:</p>
    <pre>a = 5
b = 9
setStr = f'The set is {​{ {a},{b} }​}.'
print(setStr)</pre>
    <p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the ActiveCode format implementation has a bug,
                printing doubled braces, but standard Python prints <c>{5, 9}</c>.</p>
