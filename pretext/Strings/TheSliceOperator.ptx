  <title>The Slice Operator</title>
  <p>A substring of a string is called a <term>slice</term>. Selecting a slice is similar to
            selecting a character:</p>
  <program xml:id="chp08_slice1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
singers = "Peter, Paul, and Mary"
print(singers[0:5])
print(singers[7:11])
print(singers[17:21])
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The slice operator <c>[n:m]</c> returns the part of the string from the n'th character
            to the m'th character, including the first but excluding the last. In other words,  start with the character at index n and
            go up to but do not include the character at index m.
            This
            behavior may seem counter-intuitive but if you recall the <c>range</c> function, it did not include its end
            point either.</p>
  <p>If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the
            beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the
            end of the string.</p>
  <p>There is no Index Out Of Range exception for a slice.
            A slice is forgiving and shifts any offending index to something legal.</p>

                    This is called slicing, not indexing.  It requires a start and an end.

                    Slicing will not include the character at index 11.  Just up to it (10 in this case).

                    The slice will happen first, then the repetition.  So it is ok.
