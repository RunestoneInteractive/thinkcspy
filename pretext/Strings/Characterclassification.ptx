  <title>Character classification</title>
  <p>It is often helpful to examine a character and test whether it is upper- or
            lowercase, or whether it is a character or a digit. The <c>string</c> module
            provides several constants that are useful for these purposes. One of these,
            <c>string.digits</c> is equivalent to <q>0123456789</q>.  It can be used to check if a character
            is a digit using the <c>in</c> operator.</p>
  <p>The string <c>string.ascii_lowercase</c> contains all of the ascii letters that the system
            considers to be lowercase. Similarly, <c>string.ascii_uppercase</c> contains all of the
            uppercase letters. <c>string.punctuation</c> comprises all the characters considered
            to be punctuation. Run the following:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <program xml:id="ch3_sec10_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
import string
print(string.ascii_lowercase)
print(string.ascii_uppercase)
print(string.digits)
print(string.punctuation)
        </input>
    </program>
  </blockquote>

<term>More About ASCII</term>
<p>ASCII is abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange. As computers store data in numeric values, for each character (words, punctuations, etc) a specific number is assigned to represent it. This process is called character encoding. In order to exchange informations between different computers, a set of standards were needed, from which ASCII was born. </p>
<p>ASCII contains 128 characters, where each character is assigned with a specific number. For instance uppercase alphabet starts from A = 65, while lowercase alphabet starts from a = 97 and continues as b=98, c=99, so on. Due to its limited size, this standard is replaced by Unicode which contains thousands of characters, however still useful to understand and work on encoding. </p>
