  <title>Traversal and the <c>while</c> Loop</title>
  <p>The <c>while</c> loop can also control the
            generation of the index values.  Remember that the programmer is responsible for setting up the initial
            condition, making sure that the condition is correct, and making sure that something changes inside the
            body to guarantee that the condition will eventually fail.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch08_7c" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
fruit = "apple"

position = 0
while position &lt; len(fruit):
    print(fruit[position])
    position = position + 1
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>The loop condition is <c>position &lt; len(fruit)</c>, so when <c>position</c> is equal to the
            length of the string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop is not
            executed. The last character accessed is the one with the index
    <c>len(fruit)-1</c>, which is the last character in the string.</p>
  <p>Here is the same example in codelens so that you can trace the values of the variables.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch08_7c1" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <code>
fruit = "apple"

position = 0
while position &lt; len(fruit):
    print(fruit[position])
    position = position + 1
    </code>

                    There are 2 o characters but idx does not take on the correct index values.
