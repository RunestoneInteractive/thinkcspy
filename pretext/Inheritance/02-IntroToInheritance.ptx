  <title>Introduction to Inheritance</title>
  <p>Recall the Point class from earlier in the book:</p>
  <program xml:id="pointclass_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
class Point:

    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY

    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

    def __str__(self):
        return "x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y)

p = Point(7, 6)
print(p)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Now, suppose we want to create a class that works like <c>Point</c>
            in every respect, but also keeps track of a short description for the point.
            We could create a <c>LabeledPoint</c> class by copying and pasting the definition for
            <c>Point</c>,
            changing the name to <c>LabeledPoint</c>, and modifying the class to suit our
            purposes. However, any time you copy and paste code, keep in mind that
            you are copying and pasting bugs that may exist in the code. Inheritance
            provides a way to reuse the definition of Point without having to copy and
            paste.</p>
  <p>We begin like this:</p>
  <program xml:id="labeledpoint" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
class LabeledPoint(Point):
    pass
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>This example defines a class named <c>LabeledPoint</c> that inherits from the <c>Point</c> class.
            Putting the name <c>Point</c> in parenthesis tells Python that the new class,
            <c>LabeledPoint</c>, begins with all of the methods defined in its parent, <c>Point</c>.
            For example, we can instantiate LabeledPoint using the Point constructor, and
            invoke any Point methds we want to on it:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
p = LabeledPoint(7,6)
dist = p.distanceFromOrigin()
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Now, let's refine LabeledPoint so that it holds a label, along with the x and y
            coordinates:</p>
  <program xml:id="labeledpoint_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
class LabeledPoint(Point):

    def __init__(self, initX, initY, label):
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY
        self.label = label

    def __str__(self):
        return "x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y) + " (" + self.label + ")"

labeledPt = LabeledPoint(7,6,"Here")
print(labeledPt)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Here, we have redefined two of the methods that LabeledPoint inherits from Point:
            <c>__init__()</c> and <c>__str__()</c>.
            This is called <em>overriding</em>. When a child class redefines methods that are defined
            in its parent, we say that the child <em>overrides</em> the functionality inherited from
            its parent. When both the parent class and child class have a method with the
            same name, an invocation of the method on an instance of the child class
            executes code in the child's class; an invocation of the method on an instance
            of the parent class executes code in the parent's class. For example,
            consider the following:</p>
  <program xml:id="combinedpts" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
pt = Point(5,10)
labeledPt = LabeledPoint(7, 6, "Here")

ptStr = str(pt)
labeledPtStr = str(labeledPt)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In Line 4, the call to <c>str(pt)</c> invokes the <c>__str__()</c> method in <c>Point</c>, because
            pt refers to an instance of <c>Point</c>. In Line 5, the call to <c>str(labeledPt)</c>
            invokes the <c>__str__()</c> method in <c>LabeledPoint</c>, because <c>labeledPt</c>
            refers to an instance of <c>LabeledPoint</c>.</p>
