  <title>Case Study: Structured Postal Addresses</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>Postal addresses are interesting things. Every country has its own format
            for postal addresses, and sometimes one country can have multiple address
            formats.</p>
  <p>Postal addresses generally consist of a few standard elements: the recipient
            name; street address; city or locality; state or province; and a postal code.
            However, other elements are often included, such as neighborhood, district,
            post office identifier, and so on. For example, the following is</p>
  <blockquote>
    <line_block>
      <line>Mr. Abe Jones</line>
      <line>Acme Corporation</line>
      <line>123 Somewhere Ln</line>
      <line>Greenville, SC  29609</line>
      <line>USA</line>
    </line_block>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This same address would be written as follows for delivery to the Netherlands
            (in the example, the street, city, and state are unchanged, even though they do not exist
            in the Netherlands):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <line_block>
      <line>Acme Corporation</line>
      <line>Mr. Abe Jones</line>
      <line>Somewhere Ln 123</line>
      <line>29609 SC  Greenville</line>
      <line>NETHERLANDS</line>
    </line_block>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Addresses in Ireland are complex, having up to 12 parts (such as building name and number,
            primary and secondary thoroughfare, primary and secondary locality, town, county, &#x2026;)
            plus an Eircode, a unique identifier assigned to each of the ~2 million addresses in Ireland.
            For example, Abe might live at the following address (English translation
            is given in parentheses, and would be omitted):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <line_block>
      <line>Abe Jones</line>
      <line>Cnoc na Sceiche (The Hill of the Thorn)</line>
      <line>Leac an Anfa (The Flagstone of the Storm)</line>
      <line>Cathair na Mart (The City of the Beeves)</line>
      <line>Co. Mhaigh Eo (The County of the Plain of the Yews)</line>
      <line>A65 F4E2</line>
      <line>IRELAND</line>
    </line_block>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(One would think that since each address has its own unique Eircode,
            it ought to be possible to address mail to Abe Jones, A65 F4E2, IRELAND.
            On second thought, perhaps that is not such a great idea. Can you imagine
            the practical concerns with such a scheme?)</p>
        </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="inheritance_storing-postal-addresses">
    <title>Storing Postal Addresses</title>
    <p>Suppose we want to write a contact management application. Among other things, the application
                stores names and addresses. What would be the best way to design a class that holds the
                information for an address? One approach would be to store the parts of the address that
                are consistent, such as the recipient name and the country, in instance variables, and
                store the rest of the address as a list of address lines:</p>
    <program xml:id="address_class_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
class Address:
    def __init__(self, recipient, addressLines, country):
        self.country = country
        self.recipient = recipient
        self.addressLines = addressLines


addr = Address('Abe Jones', ['123 Somewhere Ln', 'Greenville, SC  29609'], 'USA')
print(addr)
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>This approach treats an address as a collection of unstructured bits of information. If we want to
                look up an address, we can search by full name or country, but if we want to find all
                addresses in Greenville, or all addresses in zip code 29609, we can't do it very easily,
                since information such as city and zip code is mashed together in an unstructured
                address line along with the state abbreviation.</p>
    <p>An approach that stores addresses as structured pieces of information might look like this:</p>
    <program xml:id="structured_addr_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
class StructuredAddress:
    def __init__(self, country, recipient, street, city, state, postalCode):
        self.country = country
        self.recipient = recipient
        self.street = street
        self.city = city
        self.state = state
        self.postalCode = postalCode

    def display(self):
        print(self.recipient)
        print(self.street)
        print(self.city + ", " + self.state + "  " + self.postalCode)
        print(self.country)

addr = StructuredAddress('USA', 'Abe Jones', '103 Anywhere Ln',
               'Greenville', 'SC', '29609')
addr.display()
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>Now, if we have a list of StructuredAddress objects and we want to find all of the ones
                that hold addresses in Greenville, we can do it much more easily:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
for addr in addrList:
    if addr.city == 'Greenville':
        addr.display()
</input>
    </program>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="inheritance_storing-international-addresses">
    <title>Storing International Addresses</title>
    <p>But now we have another problem. Our StructuredAddress works fine for U.S. addresses,
                but not for those of other countries. Suppose we want to handle Irish and Italian
                addresses. We might enhance the display() method to handle these with appropriate
                logic:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
def display(self):
    print(self.recipient)

    if self.country == 'USA':
        print(self.street)
        print(self.city + ", " + self.state + "  " + self.postalCode)
    elif self.country == 'IRELAND':
        print(self.postalCode)
    elif self.country == 'ITALY':
        print(self.street)
        print(self.postalCode + ' ' + self.city + ' ' + self.state)
    else:
        pass

    print(self.country)
</input>
    </program>
    <p>This example works for Italian addresses because they conveniently have the same
                elements as U.S. addresses (just displayed in a slightly different order). For Irish
                addresses, we ignore the complicated address format and assume that the Irish post
                office will get mail to the recipient because of Ireland's unique Eircode scheme.
                But what if we wanted to include the additional elements of Irish addresses? We might
                create additional instance variables for those elements in our StructuredAddress class.
                However, you can probably see that approach will quickly become unwieldy.</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="inheritance_inheritance-applied">
    <title>Inheritance Applied</title>
    <p>Let's apply inheritance to the problem of managing structured postal addresses.
                We will define a base class that contains the attributes in common to all
                postal addresses: recipient and country.</p>
    <program xml:id="base_postal" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
class BasePostalAddress:
    def __init__(self, country, recipient):
        self.country = country
        self.recipient = recipient

    def display(self):
        print(self.recipient)
        print(self.country)

    def validate(self):
        return self.recipient != '' and self.country != ''
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>This class isn't very useful by itself; relatively few people in the world
                could receive mail addressed to them using only their name and country.
                But it does establish two methods to perform functionality we want all
                addresses to perform: display themselves, and check whether the required
                information is present and of an appropriate length.</p>
    <p>Next, we build on BasePostalAddress by creating a separate class for each
                country that inherits from it:</p>
    <program xml:id="international_postal" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
class IrishPostalAddress(BasePostalAddress):
    def __init__(self, recipient, postalCode):
        super().__init__("IRELAND", recipient)
        self.postalCode = postalCode

    def display(self):
        print(self.recipient)
        print(self.postalCode)
        print(self.country)

    def validate(self):
        return super().validate() and len(self.postalCode) == 7

class USPostalAddress(BasePostalAddress):
    def __init__(self, recipient, street, city, state, zipcode):
        super().__init__("USA", recipient)
        self.street = street
        self.city = city
        self.state = state
        self.zip = zipcode

    def display(self):
        print(self.recipient)
        print(self.street)
        print(self.city + ", " + self.state + "  " + self.zip)
        print(self.country)

    def validate(self):
        return (super().validate() and self.city != '' and
            len(self.state) == 2 and
            (len(self.postalCode) == 5 or len(self.postalCode) == 9))
        </input>
    </program>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="inheritance_a-list-of-addresses">
    <title>A List of Addresses</title>
    <p>Now, let's construct a list containing both US and Irish addresses,
                and display them using a loop:</p>
    <program xml:id="postal_list_ac" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
addrList = [IrishPostalAddress("Alf Jones", "A26F4G9"),
            USPostalAddress("Abe Jones", "103 Anywhere Ln",
                "Greenville", "SC", "29609"),
            IrishPostalAddress("Gabe Jones", "A65F4E2")]

for addr in addrList:
    addr.display()
        </input>
    </program>
    <p>Normally, if a program iterates over a list that contains different
                types of objects, it has to be careful about making assumptions about
                the methods and operations that it can invoke on the different objects
                in the list, since an attempt to invoke a method or apply an operator
                to an object that does not support the method or operator will result
                in a runtime error. In this case, we know that all of the objects in the list
                inherit from <c>BasePostalAddress</c>. It is safe to invoke any methods
                defined in <c>BasePostalAddress</c>, since all children of
                <c>BasePostalAddress</c> are guaranteed to contain those methods.
                Programs that use inheritance often contain loops like this.</p>
    <p>Notice something else. As the loop iterates over the list, each time
                the <c>display()</c> method is invoked, the computer will execute the one
                that is defined for the specific object referenced by <c>addr</c>. The first
                time through the loop, addr references an <c>IrishPostalAddress</c>, so the
                <c>display()</c> method for Irish addresses is invoked. The second time through
                the loop, the <c>display()</c> method in <c>USPostalAddress</c> is invoked. This
                behavior&#x2014;where the computer always executes the method that is
                defined for the object being referenced&#x2014;is called <em>polymorphism</em>.
                Python exhibits this behavior whether or not the objects in question
                utilize inheritance, but languages like Java and C++, polymorphism is
                available only through inheritance.</p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="inheritance_using-isinstance">
    <title>Using isinstance</title>
    <p>Let's try something else with our list of addresses. Suppose
                we wanted to display all addresses with a given city.
                We might write some code like this:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
for addr in addrList:
    if addr.city == 'Greenville':
        addr.display()
</input>
    </program>
    <p>However, we would get into trouble on the first iteration of the
                loop. The first address is an Irish address, which does not have a
                <c>city</c> attribute. Python would raise an error. We want to
                perform this test only for US addresses.</p>
    <p>In this case, since all addresses have a country attribute,
                we could write the loop this way:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
for addr in addrList:
    if addr.country == 'USA' and addr.city == 'Greenville':
        addr.display()
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Another way to test the address is to find out if the object
                belongs to a specific class. Python provides the <c>isinstance()</c>
                function for this purpose. <c>isinstance()</c> is designed for situations
                where you want to access a field or invoke a method on an object,
                but you want to do so only if the object provides the needed
                functionality. Given an object <em>obj</em> and a class <em>cls</em>,
                <c>isinstance(obj, cls)</c> returns True if <em>obj</em> is an instance of <em>cls</em>
                (or a subclass of <em>cls</em>), and False if it is not. Here is how we might
                use it in our loop:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
for addr in addrList:
    if isinstance(addr, USPostalAddress) and addr.city == 'Greenville':
        addr.display()
</input>
    </program>
    <p>In this version of the code, the city attribute will be tested only
                if <c>addr</c> references an instance of <c>USPostalAddress</c>, or a child of
                <c>USPostalAddress</c> (which would also have a city attribute).</p>
    <p>Now that you've learned about <c>isinstance()</c>, you should know that, like
                inheritance itself, <c>isinstance()</c> should be used sparingly. Code that
                invokes <c>isinstance()</c> is often performing work on an object that the
                object should be designed to do itself, and is not utilizing inheritance
                and polymorphism to its full potential.</p>
    <p>To make this loop better utilize inheritance and polymorphism, we need
                a way to test each address to see if it is in a given city. Let's
                add a method to BasePostalAddress for this purpose. It will
                return a boolean indicating whether the address is in a certain city.</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
class BasePostalAddress:

    ...

    def isInCity(self, city):
        return False
</input>
    </program>
    <p>BasePostalAddresses do not have a city attribute, so they just return
                False. USPostalAddresses do have a city, so we'll override this method
                for that class:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
class USPostalAddress:

    ...

    def isInCity(self, city):
        return self.city == city
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Now, we rewrite our loop to use <c>isInCity()</c> to perform the test:</p>
    <program language="python">
      <input>
for addr in addrList:
    if addr.isInCity('Greenville'):
        addr.display()
</input>
    </program>
    <p>Notice how we've eliminated the <c>isinstance()</c> test. Also, notice
                how this test works for <c>IrishPostalAddress</c> objects, even though we
                didn't define <c>isInCity()</c> for <c>IrishPostalAddress</c>, since
                <c>IrishPostalAddress</c> inherits its version from <c>BasePostalAddress</c>.</p>
