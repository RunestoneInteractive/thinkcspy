        <title>Composition vs. Inheritance</title>
        <p>Now you have seen two ways for a class to reuse code in another class. So,
            is one better than the other? When do you use inheritance, and when is
            composition the better choice?</p>
        <p>Although the subject of this chapter is inheritance, the truth is that
            composition is usually a better choice than inheritance to reuse code.
            Perhaps 95% of cases where you are debating about choosing inheritance or
            composition, you should choose composition. It&#8217;s hard to go wrong with
            composition, but you can get into all kinds of trouble if you go with
            inheritance and inheritance is not an appropriate choice.</p>
        <p>So, it&#8217;s easier to address the question of which technique to use by
            defining when inheritance is an appropriate choice.
            Inheritance is appropriate when the proposed child class (the one reusing
            the functionality in its parent) represents a <emphasis>specialization</emphasis> of its parent.
            Class A is a specialization of Class B if class A represents a specific type of
            class B. This is generally the case if you can fill in the following sentence
            with the names of the proposed child and parent classes:</p>
        <p><strong>(child class) is a type of (parent class).</strong></p>
        <p>Let&#8217;s try some examples. Using the LabeledPoint example from the previous
            section: &#8220;<c>LabeledPoint</c> is a type of <c>Point</c>.&#8221; Since a
            LabeledPoint is a specific type of Point&#8211;a Point that has a label&#8211;that
            sentence makes sense. LabeledPoint is a specialization of Point, and
            inheritance is an appropriate choice.</p>
        <p>Now, suppose you wanted to define a class that represents a rectangle.
            Like a Point, a Rectangle would need to keep track of an x and y location
            to determine its position, and might also have a width and a height.
            You&#8217;re thinking about defining Rectangle to inherit from Point, so that it
            reuses all of Point&#8217;s functionality (like knowing its position and calculating its
            distance from origin), and adding just the two new instance variables it
            needs for its width and height. From a pure code reuse standpoint,
            inheritance seems plausible. But wait&#8211;let&#8217;s apply the &#8220;is-a&#8221; linguistic test.
            Filling in the blanks in the sentence template above, we get: &#8220;Rectangle
            is a type of Point.&#8221; Most people would feel there is something wrong with
            that statement. A rectangle is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a more specific type of a point.
            A rectangle <emphasis>contains</emphasis> points and <emphasis>consists of</emphasis> points, but is not itself
            a point. Thus, it fails the linguistic test; composition is the better
            choice here.</p>
        <p>So what happens if you decide to ignore the linguistic test and go ahead
            and make Rectangle inherit from Point? In some cases, you won&#8217;t run into
            trouble right away. Often, the difficulties don&#8217;t start to crop up until
            later, when you decide to add more methods to Point (the parent) that
            aren&#8217;t appropriate for Rectangle (the child). This leads to a program
            that is confusing to understand and contains bugs that occur when
            methods intended for Point are invoked on Rectangle instances by
            mistake. Also, since inheritance is the strongest form of relationship
            between classes, changes to code in a parent class have a stronger
            likelihood of breaking code in its children than would tend to occur
            if composition were used.</p>
        <p>Inheritance is a powerful feature and, when used appropriately, a
            terrific way to reuse code. But, like most power tools, it can cut
            you up pretty badly if you don&#8217;t know what you are doing.
            Use it with caution and respect.</p>
