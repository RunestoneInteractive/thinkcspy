  <p>In Python, a <term>function</term> is a named sequence of statements
            that belong together.  Their primary purpose is to help us
            organize programs into chunks that match how we think about
            the solution to the problem.</p>
  <p xml:id="functions_index-0">The syntax for a <term>function definition</term> is:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
def name( parameters ):
    statements
</input>
  </program>
  <p>You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that
            you can't use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules
            for legal identifiers that were given previously. The parameters specify
            what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use the new function.  Another way to say this is that the parameters specify what the function needs to do its work.</p>
  <p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be
            indented from the <c>def</c>. In the examples in this book, we will use the
            standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of
            several <term>compound statements</term> we will see, all of which have the same
            pattern:</p>
  <p>
    <ol marker="1">
      <li>
        <p>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A <term>body</term> consisting of one or more Python statements, each
                    indented the same amount &#x2013; <em>4 spaces is the Python standard</em> &#x2013; from
                    the header line.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We've already seen the <c>while</c> and <c>for</c> loops which follow this pattern.</p>
  <p>In a function definition, the keyword in the header is <c>def</c>, which is
            followed by the name of the function and some <em>parameters</em> enclosed in
            parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of
            parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.</p>
  <p>We need to say a bit more about the parameters.  In the definition, the parameter list is more specifically known
            as the <term>formal parameters</term>.  This list of names describes those things that the function will
            need to receive from the user of the function.  When you use a function, you provide values to the formal parameters.</p>
  <p>The figure below shows this relationship.  A function needs certain information to do its work.  These values, often called <term>arguments</term> or <term>actual parameters</term>, are passed to the function by the user.</p>
  <image source="Functions/Figures/blackboxproc.png" width="50%"/>
  <p>This type of diagram is often called a <term>black-box diagram</term> because it only states the requirements from the perspective of the user.  The user must know the name of the function and what arguments need to be passed.  The details of how the function works are hidden inside the <q>black-box</q>.</p>
  <p>Suppose we're working with lists of numeric data and a common operation we need is to find the size of the range of numbers in a list.
    It would make sense if we did not have to duplicate all the steps each time we want to find the size of the range.   "printRange" can be thought of as an 
    <em>abstraction</em> of a number of smaller steps.  We will need to provide one piece of information for the function to do its work: the list we need the range of.</p>
  <p>Here is a program containing a function to capture this idea.  Give it a try.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch8_sec1_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      def printRange(lst):
        """Prints the size of the range of lst."""
        smallest = min(lst)
        largest = max(lst)
        print(largest - smallest)

      my_list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 	    printRange(my_list1)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>This function is named <c>printRange</c>.  It has one parameter --- a variable storing a list of numbers.  In the function definition this parameter is called 
 <c>lst</c>.   Make sure you know where the body of the function
            ends &#x2014; it depends on the indentation and the blank lines don't count for
            this purpose!</p>
  <note>
    <title>docstrings</title>
    <p>If the first thing after the function header is a string (some tools insist that
                it must be a triple-quoted string), it is called a <term>docstring</term>
                and gets special treatment in Python and in some of the programming tools.</p>
    <p>Another way to retrieve this information is to use the interactive
                interpreter, and enter the expression <c>&lt;function_name&gt;.__doc__</c>, which will retrieve the
                docstring for the function.  So the string you write as documentation at the start of a function is
                retrievable by python tools <em>at runtime</em>.  This is different from comments in your code,
                which are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.</p>
    <p>By convention, Python programmers use docstrings for the key documentation of
                their functions.</p>
  </note>
  <p xml:id="functions_index-1">Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a
            <term>function call</term>.  This is also known as a <term>function invocation</term>. We've already seen how to call some built-in functions like
            <c>print</c>, <c>range</c> and <c>int</c>. Function calls contain the name of the function to be
            executed followed by a list of values in parentheses, called <em>arguments</em>, which are assigned
            to the parameters in the function definition.
            So in the last line of
            the program, we call the function, and pass <c>my_list1</c> as the list to be analyzed.</p>
  <p>Once we've defined a function, we can call it as often as we like and its
            statements will be executed each time we call it.  In this case, we could use it to get
            the size of the range of multiple lists. Make sure you can identify all three invocations of the <c>printRange</c> function.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch8_sec1_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def printRange(lst):
  """Prints the size of the range of lst."""
  smallest = min(lst)
  largest = max(lst)
  print(largest - smallest)

my_list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
my_list2 = [2, 6, 9, 16, 42, 100, 2, 5]
printRange(my_list1)
printRange(my_list2)
printRange([5, 10, 1000, 2])
        </input>
  </program>
  <warning>
    <p>Even if a function call needs no arguments,
                the parentheses <c>( )</c> after the function name are <em>required</em>.  This
                can lead to a difficult bug:  A function name without the
                parenthesis is a legal expression <em>referring</em> to the function; for example,
                <c>print</c>, but it does
    not <em>call</em> the associated function. Try it below if you want to see.</p>

                    While some functions do calculate values, the python idea of a function is slightly different from the mathematical idea of a function in that not all functions calculate values.  Consider, for example, the turtle functions in this section.   They made the turtle draw a specific shape, rather than calculating a value.
