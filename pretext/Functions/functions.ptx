  <p>In Python, a <term>function</term> is a named sequence of statements
            that belong together.  Their primary purpose is to help us
            organize programs into chunks that match how we think about
            the solution to the problem.</p>
  <p xml:id="functions_index-0">The syntax for a <term>function definition</term> is:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
def name( parameters ):
    statements
</code>
  </program>
  <p>You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that
            you can't use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules
            for legal identifiers that were given previously. The parameters specify
            what information, if any, you have to provide in order to use the new function.  Another way to say this is that the parameters specify what the function needs to do its work.</p>
  <p>There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be
            indented from the <c>def</c>. In the examples in this book, we will use the
            standard indentation of four spaces. Function definitions are the second of
            several <term>compound statements</term> we will see, all of which have the same
            pattern:</p>
  <p>
    <ol marker="1">
      <li>
        <p>A header line which begins with a keyword and ends with a colon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A <term>body</term> consisting of one or more Python statements, each
                    indented the same amount &#x2013; <em>4 spaces is the Python standard</em> &#x2013; from
                    the header line.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>We've already seen the <c>for</c> loop which follows this pattern.</p>
  <p>In a function definition, the keyword in the header is <c>def</c>, which is
            followed by the name of the function and some <em>parameters</em> enclosed in
            parentheses. The parameter list may be empty, or it may contain any number of
            parameters separated from one another by commas. In either case, the parentheses are required.</p>
  <p>We need to say a bit more about the parameters.  In the definition, the parameter list is more specifically known
            as the <term>formal parameters</term>.  This list of names describes those things that the function will
            need to receive from the user of the function.  When you use a function, you provide values to the formal parameters.</p>
  <p>The figure below shows this relationship.  A function needs certain information to do its work.  These values, often called <term>arguments</term> or <term>actual parameters</term>, are passed to the function by the user.</p>
  <image source="Functions/Figures/blackboxproc.png" width="50%"/>
  <p>This type of diagram is often called a <term>black-box diagram</term> because it only states the requirements from the perspective of the user.  The user must know the name of the function and what arguments need to be passed.  The details of how the function works are hidden inside the <q>black-box</q>.</p>
  <p>Suppose we're working with turtles and a common operation we need is to draw
            squares.  It would make sense if we did not have to duplicate all the steps each time we want to make a square.   <q>Draw a square</q> can be thought of as an <em>abstraction</em> of a number of smaller steps.  We will need to provide two pieces of information for the function to do its work: a turtle to do the drawing and a size for the side of the square.  We could represent this using the following black-box diagram.</p>
  <image source="Functions/Figures/turtleproc.png" width="50%"/>
  <p>Here is a program containing a function to capture this idea.  Give it a try.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch04_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
import turtle

def drawSquare(t, sz):
    """Make turtle t draw a square of with side sz."""

    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(sz)
        t.left(90)


wn = turtle.Screen()              # Set up the window and its attributes
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

alex = turtle.Turtle()            # create alex
drawSquare(alex, 50)             # Call the function to draw the square passing the actual turtle and the actual side size

wn.exitonclick()
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>This function is named <c>drawSquare</c>.  It has two parameters &#x2014; one to tell
            the function which turtle to move around and the other to tell it the size
            of the square we want drawn.  In the function definition they are called <c>t</c> and <c>sz</c> respectively.   Make sure you know where the body of the function
            ends &#x2014; it depends on the indentation and the blank lines don't count for
            this purpose!</p>
  <note>
    <title>docstrings</title>
    <p>If the first thing after the function header is a string (some tools insist that
                it must be a triple-quoted string), it is called a <term>docstring</term>
                and gets special treatment in Python and in some of the programming tools.</p>
    <p>Another way to retrieve this information is to use the interactive
                interpreter, and enter the expression <c>&lt;function_name&gt;.__doc__</c>, which will retrieve the
                docstring for the function.  So the string you write as documentation at the start of a function is
                retrievable by python tools <em>at runtime</em>.  This is different from comments in your code,
                which are completely eliminated when the program is parsed.</p>
    <p>By convention, Python programmers use docstrings for the key documentation of
                their functions.</p>
  </note>
  <p xml:id="functions_index-1">Defining a new function does not make the function run. To do that we need a
            <term>function call</term>.  This is also known as a <term>function invocation</term>. We've already seen how to call some built-in functions like
            <c>print</c>, <c>range</c> and <c>int</c>. Function calls contain the name of the function to be
            executed followed by a list of values in parentheses, called <em>arguments</em>, which are assigned
            to the parameters in the function definition.
            So in the second to the last line of
            the program, we call the function, and pass <c>alex</c> as the turtle to be manipulated,
            and 50 as the size of the square we want.</p>
  <!--The parameters being sent to the function, sometimes referred to as the **actual parameters** or **arguments**,-->
  <!--represent the specific data items that the function will use when it is executing.-->
  <p>Once we've defined a function, we can call it as often as we like and its
            statements will be executed each time we call it.  In this case, we could use it to get
            one of our turtles to draw a square and then we can move the turtle and have it draw a different square in a
            different location.  Note that we lift the tail so that when <c>alex</c> moves there is no trace.  We put the tail
            back down before drawing the next square.  Make sure you can identify both invocations of the <c>drawSquare</c> function.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch04_1a" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
import turtle

def drawSquare(t, sz):
    """Make turtle t draw a square of with side sz."""

    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(sz)
        t.left(90)


wn = turtle.Screen()          # Set up the window and its attributes
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

alex = turtle.Turtle()        # create alex
drawSquare(alex, 50)          # Call the function to draw the square

alex.penup()
alex.goto(100,100)
alex.pendown()

drawSquare(alex,75)           # Draw another square

wn.exitonclick()
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>In the next example, we've changed the <c>drawSquare</c>
            function a little and we get <c>tess</c> to draw 15 squares with some variations.  Once the function has
            been defined, we can call it as many times as we like with whatever actual parameters we like.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch04_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>

    """Make turtle t draw a multi-colour square of sz."""

        t.color(i)
        t.forward(sz)
        t.left(90)

wn = turtle.Screen()             # Set up the window and its attributes

tess.pensize(3)

size = 20                        # size of the smallest square
for i in range(15):
    drawMulticolorSquare(tess, size)
    size = size + 10             # increase the size for next time
    tess.forward(10)             # move tess along a little
    tess.right(18)               # and give her some extra turn

wn.exitonclick()
        </code>
  </program>
  <warning>
    <p>Even if a function call needs no arguments,
                the parentheses <c>( )</c> after the function name are <em>required</em>.  This
                can lead to a difficult bug:  A function name without the
                parenthesis is a legal expression <em>referring</em> to the function; for example,
                <c>print</c> and <c>alex.penup</c>, but they do
                not <em>call</em> the associated functions.</p>
