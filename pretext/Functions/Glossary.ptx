                        <p>A function which interacts with the user (using <c>input</c> or <c>print</c>) when
                            it should not. Silent functions that just convert their input arguments into
                            their output results are usually the most useful ones.</p>

                        <p>Calling one function from within the body of another, or using the
                            return value of one function as an argument to the call of another.</p>

                        <p>Part of a program that can never be executed, often because it appears
                            after a <c>return</c> statement.</p>

                        <p>A program development plan intended to simplify debugging by adding and
                            testing only a small amount of code at a time.</p>

                        <p>A special Python value. One use in Python is that it is returned
                            by functions that do not execute a return statement with a return argument.</p>

                        <p>Code that is used during program development to assist with development
                            and debugging. The unit test code that we added in this chapter are
                            examples of scaffolding.</p>
