  <title>Programming With Style</title>
  <p>Readability is very important to programmers, since in practice programs are
            read and modified far more often then they are written.</p>
  <!--All the code examples-->
  <!--in this book will be consistent with the *Python Enhancement Proposal 8*-->
  <!--(`PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__), a style guide developed by the Python community.-->
  <p>We'll have more to say about style as our programs become more complex, but a
            few pointers will be helpful already:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>use 4 spaces for indentation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>imports should go at the top of the file</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>separate function definitions with two blank lines</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>keep function definitions together</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>keep top level statements, including function calls, together at the
                    bottom of the program</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
