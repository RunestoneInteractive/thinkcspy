        <title>Composition</title>
        <p>As we have already seen, you can call one function from within another.
            This ability to build functions by using other functions is called <alert>composition</alert>.</p>
        <p>As an example, we&#8217;ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the
            circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.</p>
        <p>Assume that the center point is stored in the variables <c>xc</c> and <c>yc</c>, and
            the perimeter point is in <c>xp</c> and <c>yp</c>. The first step is to find the
            radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points.
            Fortunately, we&#8217;ve just written a function, <c>distance</c>, that does just that,
            so now all we have to do is use it:</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
</input></program>
        <p>The second step is to find the area of a circle with that radius and return it.
            Again we will use one of our earlier functions:</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
result = area(radius)
return result
</input></program>
        <p>Wrapping that up in a function, we get:</p>

    <program xml:id="ch06_newarea_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
        result = dsquared**0.5
        return result

def area(radius):
    b = 3.14159 * radius**2
    return b

def area2(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    result = area(radius)
    return result

print(area2(0,0,1,1))
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>We called this function <c>area2</c> to distinguish it from the <c>area</c> function
            defined earlier. There can only be one function with a given name within a
            module.</p>
        <p>Note that we could have written the composition without storing the intermediate results.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
def area2(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))
</input></program>
