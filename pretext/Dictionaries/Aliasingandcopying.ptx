  <title>Aliasing and Copying</title>
  <p>Because dictionaries are mutable, you need to be aware of aliasing (as we saw with lists).  Whenever
            two variables refer to the same dictionary object, changes to one affect the other.
            For example, <c>opposites</c> is a dictionary that contains pairs
            of opposites.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch12_dict11" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
opposites = {'up': 'down', 'right': 'wrong', 'true': 'false'}
alias = opposites

print(alias is opposites)

alias['right'] = 'left'
print(opposites['right'])
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>As you can see from the <c>is</c> operator, <c>alias</c> and <c>opposites</c> refer to the same object.</p>
  <p>If you want to modify a dictionary and keep a copy of the original, use the dictionary
            <c>copy</c> method.  Since <em>acopy</em> is a copy of the dictionary, changes to it will not effect the original.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
acopy = opposites.copy()
acopy['right'] = 'left'    # does not change opposites
</code>
  </program>

                    The dictionary is mutable so changes can be made to the keys and values.

        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Yes, since yourdict is an alias for mydict, the value for the key elephant has been changed.

        <statement>
          <p>Error, there are two different keys named elephant.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    There is only one dictionary with only one key named elephant.  The dictionary has two different names, mydict and yourdict.
