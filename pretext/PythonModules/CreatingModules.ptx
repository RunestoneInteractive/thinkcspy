  <title>Creating Modules</title>
  <p>You've seen how to <em>use</em> modules like <c>random</c>, <c>math</c>, and <c>turtle</c>, but how would you <em>create</em> a module?</p>
  <p>Every time you've written a Python script you've created a module!</p>
  <p>A Python module is just a Python source code file.  Let's consider the Python file shown below.</p>
  <p>
    <em>coffee_shop.py</em>
  </p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
"""
The coffee shop module contains functions and contains variables
important to implementing a coffee shop.

# Set some variables
shop_name = "Runestone Brew House"
coffee_sizes = ["small", "medium", "large"]
coffee_roasts = ["hot chocolate", "light", "medium", "dark", "espresso"]
</input>
  </program>
  <p>This is a Python script named <c>coffee_shop.py</c> that contains three variables: <c>shop_name</c>, <c>coffee_sizes</c>, and <c>coffee_roasts</c>.  The <c>shop_name</c> is a string, <c>coffee_sizes</c> is a list containing strings, and <c>coffee_roasts</c> is also a list containing strings.</p>

  <p>That's so great!  We've got the basics of a coffee shop.  All you need is some roasted coffee and cups.  You're good to go.</p>
  <p>If you try to run that code though, it doesn't do much that's visible to a user&#x2026;</p>
  <p>How can we use the <c>coffee_shop</c> module?  We can import it and use it in other Python source code files.  Let's consider the Python file shown below.</p>
  <p>
    <em>coffee_customer.py</em>
  </p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
import coffee_shop

# Output the information we know from the module
print("Welcome to", coffee_shop.shop_name)
print("Available sizes:", coffee_shop.coffee_sizes)
print("Available roasts:", coffee_shop.coffee_roasts)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>This is a Python script named <c>coffee_customer.py</c> that imports our <c>coffee_shop</c> module, then prints out the information from that module.</p>
  <note>
    <title>Note</title>
    <p>The module files must be in the same directory on your computer for Python to know how to import them automatically</p>

                    Modules should include comment blocks at the top, but writing a comment block at the top of a file does not create a new module.

  <p>We use <term>dot notation</term> to grab the <c>shop_name</c>, <c>coffee_sizes</c>, and <c>coffee_roasts</c> variables from the <c>coffee_shop</c> module.  Then we print them out as parts of nice messages.</p>
  <p>Variables aren't the only thing we can place in modules though&#x2026;  We can put any valid Python code in them.</p>

  <p>We added some lines to our <c>coffee_customer</c> script&#x2026;  Now after printing data nicely, <c>coffee_customer</c> asks the user for a size and a roast.  These are the parameters required by our <c>order_coffee</c> function over in the <c>coffee_shop</c> module!</p>
  <p>Call the <c>order_coffee</c> function with <term>dot notation</term>, just like retrieving variable values.  The function call is the line that says <c>shop_says = coffee_shop.order_coffee(order_size, order_roast)</c>.  The function returns something, so we save that off in <c>shop_says</c>.  The next line prints out whatever the shop said.</p>
  <p>Coffee shops do more than just coffee!  Maybe you want some milk.  We need to add some functionality to our coffee shop.  Check it out below.</p>
