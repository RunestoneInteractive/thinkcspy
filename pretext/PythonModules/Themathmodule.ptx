  <title>The math module</title>
  <p>The <c>math</c> module contains the kinds of mathematical functions you would typically find on
    your calculator and some mathematical constants like pi and
    e. As we noted above, when we <c>import math</c>, we create a reference to a module
    object that contains these elements.</p>
  <image source="PythonModules/Figures/mathmod.png" width="50%" />
  <p>Here are some items from the math module in action. If you want more information, you can check
    out the <url href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/math.html#module-math"
      visual="http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/math.html#module-math">Math Module</url> Python
    Documentation.</p>
  <program xml:id="chmodule_02" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import math

print(math.pi)
print(math.e)

print(math.sqrt(2.0))

print(math.sin(math.radians(90)))   # sin of 90 degrees
        </input>
  </program>
  <!--Like
  almost all other programming languages, angles are expressed in *radians*-->
  <!--rather
  than degrees.  There are two functions ``radians`` and ``degrees`` to-->
  <!--convert
  between the two popular ways of measuring angles.-->
  <p>Notice another difference between this module and our use of <c>turtle</c>. In <c>turtle</c> we create
    objects (either <c>Turtle</c> or <c>Screen</c>) and call methods on those objects. Remember that a turtle is
    a data object (recall <c>alex</c> and <c>tess</c>). We need to create one in order to use it. When we
    say <c>alex = turtle.Turtle()</c>, we are calling the constructor for the Turtle class which returns a single turtle
    object.</p>
  <p>Mathematical functions do not need to be constructed. They simply perform a task. They are all
    housed together in a module called math. Once we have
    imported the math module, anything defined there can be used in our program. Notice that we
    always use the name of the module followed by a dot followed
    by the specific item from the module (<c>math.sqrt</c>). You can think of this as lastname.firstname
    where the lastname is the module family and the firstname is the individual entry in the module.</p>
  <p>If you have not done so already, take a look at the documentation for the math module.</p>

      <p>Which statement allows you to use the math module in your program?</p>

          <p>
            The module must be imported before you can use anything declared inside the module.

            The correct term is not include, but you are close.

        <feedback>
          <p>
            You will be using parts of the module, but that is not the right term.

        <statement>
          <p>You don't need a statement. You can always use the math module</p>

          <p>
            You cannot use a Python module without a statement at the top of your program that
            explicitly tells Python you want to use the module.
