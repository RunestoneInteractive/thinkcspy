        The
        <title_reference>random</title_reference>
        module
    </title>
    <p>
        We often want to use
        <alert>random numbers</alert>
        in programs.  Here are a few typical uses:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To play a game of chance where the computer needs to throw some dice, pick a number, or flip a coin,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To shuffle a deck of playing cards randomly,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To randomly allow a new enemy spaceship to appear and shoot at you,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To simulate possible rainfall when we make a computerized model for
                    estimating the environmental impact of building a dam,</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For encrypting your banking session on the Internet.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Python provides a module
        <c>random</c>
        that helps with tasks like this.  You can
            take a look at it in the documentation.  Here are the key things we can do with it.

        <caption />
        <program xml:id="chmodule_rand_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
import random

prob = random.random()
print(prob)

diceThrow = random.randrange(1, 7)       # return an int, one of 1,2,3,4,5,6
print(diceThrow)
        </input>
        </program>
    </listing>
    <p>Press the run button a number of times.  Note that the values change each time.  These are random numbers.</p>
    <p>
        The
        <c>randrange</c>
        function generates an integer between its lower and upper
            argument, using the same semantics as
        <c>range</c>
        &#8212; so the lower bound is included, but
            the upper bound is excluded.   All the values have an equal probability of occurring
            (i.e. the results are
        <em>uniformly</em>
        distributed).
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <c>random()</c>
        function returns a floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0) &#8212; the
            square bracket means &#8220;closed interval on the left&#8221; and the round parenthesis means
            &#8220;open interval on the right&#8221;.  In other words, 0.0 is possible, but all returned
            numbers will be strictly less than 1.0.  It is usual to
        <em>scale</em>
        the results after
            calling this method, to get them into a range suitable for your application.
    </p>
    <p>In the
            case shown here, we&#8217;ve converted the result of the method call to a number in
            the range [0.0, 5.0).  Once more, these are uniformly distributed numbers &#8212; numbers
            close to 0 are just as likely to occur as numbers close to 0.5, or numbers close to 1.0.
            If you continue to press the run button you will see random values between 0.0 and up to but not including 5.0.</p>

    <p xml:id="python_modules_index-0">
        It is important to note that
            random number generators are based on a
        <alert>deterministic</alert>
        algorithm &#8212; repeatable and predictable.
            So they&#8217;re called
        <alert>pseudo-random</alert>
        generators &#8212; they are not genuinely random.
            They start with a
        <em>seed</em>
        value. Each time you ask for another random number, you&#8217;ll get
            one based on the current seed attribute, and the state of the seed (which is one
            of the attributes of the generator) will be updated.  The good news is that each time you run your program, the seed value
            is likely to be different meaning that even though the random numbers are being created algorithmically, you will likely
            get random behavior each time you execute.

                    Computers generate random numbers using a deterministic algorithm.  This means that if anyone ever found out the algorithm they could accurately predict the next value to be generated and would always win the lottery.
