  <title>Looping and Counting</title>
  <p>We will finish this chapter with a few more examples that show variations on the theme of iteration through the characters of a string.  We will implement a few of the methods that we described earlier to show how they can be done.</p>
  <p>The following program counts the number of times a particular letter, <c>aChar</c>, appears in a
            string.  It is another example of the accumulator pattern that we have seen in previous chapters.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp08_fun2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def count(text, aChar):
    lettercount = 0
    for c in text:
        if c == aChar:
            lettercount = lettercount + 1
    return lettercount

print(count("banana","a"))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The function <c>count</c> takes a string as its parameter.  The <c>for</c> statement iterates through each character in
            the string and checks to see if the character is equal to the value of <c>aChar</c>.  If so, the counting variable, <c>lettercount</c>, is incremented by one.
            When all characters have been processed, the <c>lettercount</c> is returned.</p>
