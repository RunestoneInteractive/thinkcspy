  <title><c>break</c> and <c>continue</c></title>

  <p>In loops, we sometimes want to traverse <em>until</em> we reach a certain value.
    We could make a loop condition with a boolean that is toggled as True once we
    reach that value, but there's an easier way: the <term>break</term> statement.</p>

  <p>When a <c>break</c> statement is reached, the loop immediately ends and proceeds with the code after the loop.
    <c>break</c> is only a valid statement inside of loops, such as the following:</p>
  
  <program xml:id="ch7_sec4_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
i = 0
while i &lt; 10:
  if i == 5:
    break
  print(i)
  i += 1
</input>
  </program>

  <p>The <term>continue</term> statement is another keyword that we can use in loops.
    When a <c>continue</c> statement is reached, the current iteration is stopped (similar to break),
    however, the loop will <em>continue</em> running for all iterations after the current one.</p>

  <program xml:id="ch7_sec4_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
i = 0
while i &lt; 10:
  if i == 5:
    continue
  print(i)
  i += 1
</input>
  </program>

  <note><p>Notice the difference between the activecode example above for <c>break</c> and this example with <c>continue</c>.
  Neither loop prints <c>5</c>, but in the loop with <c>continue</c>, it continues iterating after where <c>5</c> would have been.</p></note>
