  <title>The <c>while</c> Statement</title>
  <!--<video xml:id="whileloop" youtube="blTBEqybQmQ" width="auto"/>-->
  <p>Let's look at our first Python statement that can be used to build an iteration.  It is called the <c>while</c> statement. When used with other code it can be used to 
    repeat code in a <term>while loop</term>. Similar to the <c>if</c> statement, it uses
    a boolean expression to control the flow of execution.  The body of while (code indented one space in) will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean 
    expression evaluates to <c>True</c>.</p>
  <p>Here is a simple example that counts down from 10 to 0.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch7_sec2_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      count = 10
      while count > 0:
          print(count)
          count = count - 1
      print("Blastoff!")
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    <li>
      <p><b>count</b> is a normal variable here, but since it is governing the <c>while</c> loop it is also called the <term>loop variable</term>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Line 2 here is the <term>loop condition</term>. It must always be a boolean expression that will evaluate to <c>False</c> or <c>True</c>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Lines 3 and 4 are the <term>loop body</term>.  The loop body is always
  indented. The indentation determines exactly what statements are "in the
  loop".  The loop body is run each time the loop is repeated.</p>      
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>On each <em>iteration</em> or <em>pass</em> of the loop, a check is done to see if
  the loop condition is True (if <c>count</c> is greater than zero).  If it is not (this is
  called the <term>terminating condition</term> of the loop), the loop has finished.
  Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body.</p>      
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If <c>count</c> is greater than zero, the loop body is executed again.</p>      
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns
  to the <c>while</c> statement, to see if the loop should repeat.</p>      
    </li>
  </p>

  <p>Notice that if the condition is <c>False</c> the first time through the
    loop, the statements inside the loop are never executed.</p>

  <warning>
    <p>Though Python's <c>while</c> is very close to the English <q>while</q>,
                there is an important difference:  In English <q>while X, do Y</q>,
                we usually assume that immediately after X becomes false, we stop
                with Y.  In Python there is <em>not</em> an immediate stop:  After the
                initial test, any following tests come only after the execution of
                the <em>whole</em> body, even if the condition becomes false in the middle of the loop body.</p>
  </warning>

  <p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that
            eventually the condition becomes <c>False</c> and the loop terminates. Otherwise the
            loop will repeat forever. This is called an <term>infinite loop</term>.
            An endless
            source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the
            directions written on the back of the shampoo bottle (lather, rinse, repeat) create an infinite loop.</p>

  <p>We can use the <c>while</c> loop to create any type of iteration we wish, making it more general-purpose than the <c>for</c> loop we'll learn next week.  
  For example, let us consider a program that adds all numbers from <c>1</c> to <c>n</c>. To do this, we will create a variable called <c>aNumber</c> and initialize it to 
  1, the first number in the summation.  Every iteration will add <c>aNumber</c> to the running total until all the values have been used.
  In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to <c>True</c> as long as we want to keep adding values to our 
  running total.  In this case, as long as <c>aNumber</c> is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going.</p>

  <p>Here is the summation program that uses a while statement.</p>

  <program xml:id="ch7_sec2_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      """ Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n """
      aBound = int(input("Please give a number n: "))
      theSum  = 0
      aNumber = 1
      while aNumber &lt;= aBound:
          theSum = theSum + aNumber
          aNumber = aNumber + 1
      print(theSum)
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>You can almost read the <c>while</c> statement as if it were in natural language. It means,
            while <c>aNumber</c> is less than or equal to <c>aBound</c>, continue executing the body of the loop. Within
            the body, each time, update <c>theSum</c> using the accumulator pattern and increment <c>aNumber</c>. After the body of the loop, we go back up to the condition of the <c>while</c> and reevaluate it.  When <c>aNumber</c> becomes greater than <c>aBound</c>, the condition fails and flow of control continues to the <c>return</c> statement.</p>
  
  <!--<p>The same program in codelens will allow you to observe the flow of execution.</p>
  
  <program xml:id="ch7_sec2_p3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      """ Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n """
      aBound = int(input("Please give a number n: "))
      theSum  = 0
      aNumber = 1
      while aNumber &lt;= aBound:
          theSum = theSum + aNumber
          aNumber = aNumber + 1
      print(theSum)
    </input>
  </program>-->

  <p>In the case shown above, we can prove that the loop terminates because we
            know that the value of <c>aBound</c> is finite, and we can see that the value of <c>aNumber</c>
            increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will have to exceed <c>aBound</c>. In
            other cases, it is not so easy to tell.</p>

                    The loop will run as long as n is positive.  In this case, we can see that n will never become non-positive.

                    It is perfectly valid to compare n to 0.  Though indirectly, this is what causes the infinite loop.

                    The loop condition must become False for the loop to terminate, but n by itself is not the condition in this case.
