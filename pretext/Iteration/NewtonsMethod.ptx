  <title>Newton's Method</title>
  <p>Loops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting
            with an approximate answer and iteratively improving it.</p>
  <p>For example, one way of computing square roots is Newton's method.  Suppose
            that you want to know the square root of <c>n</c>. If you start with almost any
            approximation, you can compute a better approximation with the following
            formula:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
better =  1/2 * (approx + n/approx)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>Execute this algorithm a few times using your calculator.  Can you
            see why each iteration brings your estimate a little closer?  One of the amazing
            properties of this particular algorithm is how quickly it converges to an accurate
            answer.</p>
  <p>The following implementation of Newton's method requires two parameters.  The first is the
            value whose square root will be approximated.  The second is the number of times to iterate the
            calculation yielding a better result.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp07_newtonsdef" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
n = 100
howmany = 10

approx = 0.5 * n
for i in range(howmany):
	betterapprox = 0.5 * (approx + n/approx)
	approx = betterapprox
prin(betterapprox)
    </input>
  </program>
  <note>
    <title>Modify the program &#x2026;</title>
    <p>The values used in the previous example produce the correct square root for 100.  However, were 10 iterations required to get the correct answer? 
      Experiment with different values for the number of repetitions (howmany on line 2). Find the <b>smallest</b> value for the number of 
      repetitions that will produce the <b>correct</b> result.</p>
  </note>
  <p>Repeating more than the required number of times is a waste of computing resources. So definite iteration is not a good solution to this problem.</p>
  <p>In general, Newton's algorithm will eventually reach a point where the new approximation is no better than the previous.  At that point, we could simply stop.
            In other words, by repeatedly applying this formula until the better approximation gets close
            enough to the previous one, we can write a function for computing the square root that uses the number of iterations necessary and no more.</p>
  <p>This implementation, shown in codelens,
            uses a <c>while</c> condition to execute until the approximation is no longer changing.  Each time through the loop we compute a <q>better</q> approximation using the formula described earlier.  As long as the <q>better</q> is different, we try again.  Step through the program and watch the approximations get closer and closer.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp07_newtonswhile" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
n = 10
approx = 0.5 * n
better = 0.5 * (approx + n/approx)
while better != approx:
  approx = better
  better = 0.5 * (approx + n/approx)
print(approx)
    </input>
  </program>
  <note>
    <p>The <c>while</c> statement shown above uses comparison of two floating point numbers in the condition.  Since floating point numbers are themselves approximation of real numbers in mathematics, it is often
                better to compare for a result that is within some small threshold of the value you are looking for.</p>
