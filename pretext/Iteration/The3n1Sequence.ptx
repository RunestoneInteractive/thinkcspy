  <title>The 3n + 1 Sequence</title>
  <p>As another example of iteration with <c>while</c>, let's look at a sequence that has fascinated mathematicians for many years.
            The rule  for creating the sequence is to start from
            some positive integer, call it <c>n</c>, and to generate
            the next term of the sequence from <c>n</c>, either by halving <c>n</c>,
            whenever <c>n</c> is even, or else by multiplying it by three and adding 1 when it is odd.  The sequence
            terminates when <c>n</c> reaches 1.</p>
  <p>This Python code captures that algorithm.  Try running this program several times supplying different values for n.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch7_sec7_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      n = 3

      """ Print the 3n+1 sequence from n, terminating when it reaches 1."""
      while n != 1:
        print(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:        # n is even
          n = n // 2
        else:                 # n is odd
          n = n * 3 + 1
      print(n)                  # the last print is 1
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>The condition for this loop is <c>n != 1</c>.  The loop will continue running until
            <c>n == 1</c> (which will make the condition false).</p>
  <p>Each time through the loop, the program prints the value of <c>n</c> and then
            checks whether it is even or odd using the remainder operator. If it is even, the value of <c>n</c> is divided
            by 2 using integer division. If it is odd, the value is replaced by <c>n * 3 + 1</c>.
            Try some other examples.</p>
  <p>Since <c>n</c> sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious
            proof that <c>n</c> will ever reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some
            particular values of <c>n</c>, we can prove termination. For example, if the
            starting value is a power of two, then the value of <c>n</c> will be even each
            time through the loop until it reaches 1.</p>
  <p>You might like to have some fun and see if you can find a small starting
            number that needs more than a hundred steps before it terminates.</p>

  <p>Particular values aside, the interesting question is whether we can prove that
            this sequence terminates for <em>all</em> positive values of <c>n</c>. So far, no one has been able
            to prove it <em>or</em> disprove it!</p>
  <p>Think carefully about what would be needed for a proof or disproof of the hypothesis
            <em><q>All positive integers will eventually converge to 1</q></em>.  With fast computers we have
            been able to test every integer up to very large values, and so far, they all
            eventually end up at 1.  But this doesn't mean that there might not be some
            as-yet untested number which does not reduce to 1.</p>
  <p>You'll notice that if you don't stop when you reach one, the sequence gets into
            its own loop:  1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, and so on.  One possibility is that there might
            be other cycles that we just haven't found.</p>
  <!--<note>
    <title>Choosing between <c>for</c> and <c>while</c></title>
    <p>Use a <c>for</c> loop if you know the maximum number of times that you'll
                need to execute the body.  For example, if you're traversing a list of elements,
                or can formulate a suitable call to <c>range</c>, then choose the <c>for</c> loop.</p>
    <p>So any problem like <q>iterate this weather model run for 1000 cycles</q>, or <q>search this
                list of words</q>, <q>check all integers up to 10000 to see which are prime</q> suggest that a <c>for</c> loop is best.</p>
    <p>By contrast, if you are required to repeat some computation until some condition is
                met, as we did in this 3n + 1 problem, you'll need a <c>while</c> loop.</p>
    <p>As we noted before, the first case is called <term>definite iteration</term> &#x2014; we have some definite bounds for
                what is needed.   The latter case is called <term>indefinite iteration</term> &#x2014; we are not sure
                how many iterations we'll need &#x2014; we cannot even establish an upper bound!</p>

  <exercise label="ch7_sec7_q1">
    <statement>
      <p>Consider the code that prints the 3n+1 sequence in ActiveCode box 6.  Will the while loop in this code always terminate for any positive integer value of n?</p>
    </statement>
    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    The 3n+1 sequence has not been proven to terminate for all values of n.
                </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>No.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    It has not been disproven that the 3n+1 sequence will terminate for all values of n.  In other words, there might be some value for n such that this sequence does not terminate. We just have not found it yet.
                </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>No one knows.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    That this sequence terminates for all values of n has not been proven or disproven so no one knows whether the while loop will always terminate or not.
