  <title>Instances as Return Values</title>
  <p>Functions and methods can return objects.  This is actually nothing new since everything in Python is an object and we have
            been returning values for quite some time.  The difference here is that we want to have the method create an object using
            the constructor and then return it as the value of the method.</p>
  <p>Suppose you have a point object
            and wish to find the midpoint halfway between it and some other target point.  We would like to write a method, call
            it <c>halfway</c> that takes another <c>Point</c> as a parameter and returns the <c>Point</c> that is halfway between the point and
            the target.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp13_classesmid1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
class Point:

    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        """ Create a new point at the given coordinates. """
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY

    def getX(self):
        return self.x

    def getY(self):
        return self.y

    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

    def __str__(self):
        return "x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y)

    def halfway(self, target):
         mx = (self.x + target.x) / 2
         my = (self.y + target.y) / 2
         return Point(mx, my)

p = Point(3, 4)
q = Point(5, 12)
mid = p.halfway(q)

print(mid)
print(mid.getX())
print(mid.getY())
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The resulting Point, <c>mid</c>, has an x value of 4 and a y value of 8.  We can also use any other methods since <c>mid</c> is a
            <c>Point</c> object.</p>
  <p>In the definition of the method <c>halfway</c> see how the requirement to always use dot notation with attributes disambiguates
            the meaning of the attributes <c>x</c> and <c>y</c>:
            We can always see whether the coordinates of Point <c>self</c> or <c>target</c> are being referred to.</p>
