  <title>Objects as Arguments and Parameters</title>
  <p>You can pass an object as an argument in the usual way.  We've already seen
            this in some of the turtle examples where we passed the turtle to
            some function like <c>drawRectangle</c> so that the function could
            control and use whatever turtle instance we passed to it.</p>
  <p>Here is a simple function called <c>distance</c> involving our new <c>Point</c> objects.  The job of this function is to figure out the
            distance between two points.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp13_classes6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import math

class Point:
    """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """

    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        """ Create a new point at the given coordinates. """
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY

    def getX(self):
        return self.x

    def getY(self):
        return self.y

    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5

def distance(point1, point2):
    xdiff = point2.getX() - point1.getX()
    ydiff = point2.getY() - point1.getY()

    dist = math.sqrt(xdiff**2 + ydiff**2)
    return dist

p = Point(4, 3)
q = Point(0, 0)
print(distance(p, q))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p><c>distance</c> takes two points and returns the distance between them.  Note that <c>distance</c> is <term>not</term> a method of the Point class.  You can see this by looking at the indentation pattern.  It is not inside the class definition.  The other way we
            can know that <c>distance</c> is not a method of Point is that <c>self</c> is not included as a formal parameter.  In addition, we do not invoke <c>distance</c> using the dot notation.</p>
