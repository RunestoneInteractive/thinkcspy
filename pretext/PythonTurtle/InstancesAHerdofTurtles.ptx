    <title>Instances &#8212; A Herd of Turtles</title>
    <p>
        Just like we can have many different integers in a program, we can have many
            turtles.  Each of them is an independent object and we call each one an
        <alert>instance</alert>
        of the Turtle type (class).  Each instance has its own
            attributes and methods &#8212; so alex might draw with a thin black pen and be at
            some position, while tess might be going in her own direction with a fat pink
            pen.  So here is what happens when alex completes a square and tess
            completes her triangle:

        Here are some
        <em>How to think like a computer scientist</em>
        observations:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    There are 360 degrees in a full circle.  If you add up all the turns that a
                    turtle makes,
                    <em>no matter what steps occurred between the turns</em>
                    , you can
                    easily figure out if they add up to some multiple of 360.  This should
                    convince you that alex is facing in exactly the same direction as he was when
                    he was first created. (Geometry conventions have 0 degrees facing East and
                    that is the case here too!)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We could have left out the last turn for alex, but that would not have been
                    as satisfying.  If you&#8217;re asked to draw a closed shape like a square or a
                    rectangle, it is a good idea to complete all the turns and to leave the
                    turtle back where it started, facing the same direction as it started in.
                    This makes reasoning about the program and composing chunks of code into
                    bigger programs easier for us humans!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    We did the same with tess: she drew her triangle and turned through a full
                    360 degress.  Then we turned her around and moved her aside.  Even the blank
                    line 18 is a hint about how the programmer&#8217;s
                    <em>mental chunking</em>
                    is working: in
                    big terms, tess&#8217; movements were chunked as &#8220;draw the triangle&#8221;  (lines 12-17)
                    and then &#8220;move away from the origin&#8221; (lines 19 and 20).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>One of the key uses for comments is to record your mental chunking, and big
                    ideas.   They&#8217;re not always explicit in the code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>And, uh-huh, two turtles may not be enough for a herd, but you get the idea!</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
