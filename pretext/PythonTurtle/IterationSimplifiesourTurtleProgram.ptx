    <title>Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program</title>
    <p>
        To draw a square we&#8217;d like to do the same thing four times &#8212; move the turtle forward some distance and turn 90 degrees.  We previously used 8 lines of Python code to have alex draw the four sides of a
            square.  This next program does exactly the same thing but, with the help of the for statement, uses just three lines (not including the setup code).  Remember that the for statement will repeat the
        <title_reference>forward</title_reference>
        and
        <title_reference>left</title_reference>
        four times, one time for
            each value in the list.
    </p>

        <program xml:id="ch03_for1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:      # repeat four times
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
        </input>

    <p>
        While &#8220;saving some lines of code&#8221; might be convenient, it is not the big
            deal here.  What is much more important is that we&#8217;ve found a &#8220;repeating
            pattern&#8221; of statements, and we reorganized our program to repeat the pattern.
            Finding the chunks and somehow getting our programs arranged around those
            chunks is a vital  skill when learning
        <em>How to think like a computer scientist</em>
        .
    </p>
    <p>The values [0,1,2,3] were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times.
            We could have used any four values.  For example, consider the following program.</p>

    <listing xml:id="ch03_forcolor">
        <caption />
        <program xml:id="ch03_forcolor_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:      # repeat four times
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
        </input>
        </program>
    </listing>
    <p>
        In the previous example, there were four integers in the list.  This time there are four strings.  Since there are four items in the list, the iteration will still occur four times.
        <c>aColor</c>
        will
            take on each color in the list.  We can even take this one step further and use the value of
        <c>aColor</c>
        as part
            of the computation.
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="colorlist">
        <caption />
        <program xml:id="colorlist_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
   alex.color(aColor)
   alex.forward(50)
   alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
        </input>
        </program>
    </listing>
    <p>
        In this case, the value of
        <c>aColor</c>
        is used to change the color attribute of
        <c>alex</c>
        .  Each iteration causes
        <c>aColor</c>
        to change to the next value in the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        The for-loop is our first example of a
        <alert>compound statement</alert>
        .
            Syntactically a compound statement is a statement.
            The level of indentation of
            a (whole) compound statement is the indentation of its heading.
            In the example above there are five statements with the same
            indentation, executed sequentially: the import, 2 assignments, the
        <em>whole</em>
        for-loop,
            and
        <c>wn.exitonclick()</c>
        .  The for-loop compound statement is executed completely before
            going on to the next sequential statement,
        <c>wn.exitonclick()</c>
        .
