  <title>Flow of Execution of the for Loop</title>
  <p>As a program executes, the interpreter always keeps track of which statement is
            about to be executed.  We call this the <term>control flow</term>, or the <term>flow of
                execution</term> of the program.  When humans execute programs, they often use their
            finger to point to each statement in turn.  So you could think of control flow
            as <q>Python's moving finger</q>.
  </p>
  <p>Control flow until now has been strictly top to bottom, one statement at a
            time.  We call this type of control <term>sequential</term>.  In Python flow is sequential as long as
            successive statements are indented the <em>same</em> amount.  The <c>for</c> statement
            introduces indented sub-statements after the for-loop heading.</p>
  <p>Flow of control is often easy to visualize and understand if we draw a flowchart.
            This flowchart shows the exact steps and logic of how the <c>for</c> statement executes.</p>

  <p>A codelens demonstration is a good way to help you visualize exactly how the flow of control
            works with the for loop.  Try stepping forward and backward through the program by pressing
            the buttons.  You can see the value of <c>name</c> change as the loop iterates through the list of friends.</p>
