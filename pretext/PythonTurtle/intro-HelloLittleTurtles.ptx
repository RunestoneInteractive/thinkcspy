            <p>There are many <emphasis>modules</emphasis> in Python that provide very powerful features that we
            can use in our own programs.  Some of these can send email or fetch web pages. Others allow us to perform complex mathematical calculations.
            In this chapter we will introduce a module that allows us to create a data object called a <strong>turtle</strong> that can be used to draw pictures.</p>
        <!--turtles and get them-->
        <!--turn left, etc.  Your turtle's tail is also endowed with the ability to leave-->
        <!--to draw shapes and patterns.-->
        <p>Turtle graphics, as it is known, is based on a very simple
            metaphor. Imagine that you have a turtle that understands English.  You can
            tell your turtle to do simple commands such as go forward and turn right.  As the turtle
            moves around, if its tail is down touching the ground, it will
            draw a line (leave a trail behind) as it moves.  If you tell your turtle to lift up its tail it can
            still move around but will not leave a trail.  As you will see, you can make
            some pretty amazing drawings with this simple capability.</p>
        <note>
            <p>The turtles are fun, but the real purpose of the chapter is to teach ourselves
                a little more Python and to develop our theme of <emphasis>computational thinking</emphasis>,
                or <emphasis>thinking like a computer scientist</emphasis>.  Most of the Python covered here will
                be explored in more depth later.</p>
