  <title>Our First Turtle Program</title>
  <p>Let's try a couple of lines of Python code to create a new turtle and
            start drawing a simple figure like a rectangle.
            We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name alex, but remember that you can choose any name you wish as long
            as you follow the naming rules
            from the previous chapter.</p>
  <p>The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the rectangle.
            After line 4 you will have a straight line going from the center of the
            drawing canvas towards the right.  After line 6, you will have a canvas with a
            turtle and a half drawn rectangle.  Press the run button to try it and see.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch03_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import turtle               # allows us to use the turtles library
wn = turtle.Screen()        # creates a graphics window
alex = turtle.Turtle()      # create a turtle named alex
alex.forward(150)           # tell alex to move forward by 150 units
alex.left(90)               # turn by 90 degrees
alex.forward(75)            # complete the second side of a rectangle
            </input>
  </program>
  <p>Here are a couple of things you'll need to understand about this program.</p>
  <p>The first line tells Python to load a <term>module</term> named <c>turtle</c>.  That module
            brings us two new types that we can use: the <c>Turtle</c> type, and the
            <c>Screen</c> type.  The dot notation <c>turtle.Turtle</c> means <em><q>The Turtle type
                that is defined within the turtle module</q></em>.   (Remember that Python is case
            sensitive, so the module name, <c>turtle</c>, with a lowercase <title_reference>t</title_reference>, is different from the type
            <c>Turtle</c> because of the uppercase <title_reference>T</title_reference>.)
        </p>
  <p>We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would
            prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python
            simply a canvas), which we assign to variable <title_reference>wn</title_reference>. Every window
            contains a <term>canvas</term>, which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.</p>
  <p>In line 3 we create a turtle. The variable <c>alex</c> is made to refer to this
            turtle.   These first three lines set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.</p>
  <p>In lines 4-6, we instruct the <term>object</term>
            <c>alex</c> to move and to turn. We do this
            by <term>invoking</term> or activating alex's <term>methods</term> &#x2014; these are the
            instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.  Here the dot indicates that
            the methods invoked belong to and refer to the object <c>alex</c>.
        </p>
  <note>
    <title>Complete the rectangle &#x2026;</title>
    <p>Modify the program by adding the commands necessary to have <em>alex</em> complete the
                rectangle.</p>

  <p>An object can have various methods &#x2014; things it can do &#x2014; and it can also
            have <term>attributes</term> &#x2014; (sometimes called <em>properties</em>).  For example, each
            turtle has a <em>color</em> attribute.  The method invocation  <title_reference>alex.color(<q>red</q>)</title_reference>
            will make alex red and the line that it draws will be red too.</p>
  <p>The color of the turtle, the width of its pen(tail), the position of the turtle
            within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its
            current <term>state</term>.   Similarly, the window object has a background color which is part of its state.</p>
  <p>Quite a number of attributes and methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and
            window objects.  In the example below, we show just show a couple and have only commented those
            lines that are different from the previous example.  Note also that we have decided to call our turtle object <em>tess</em>.
        </p>
  <program xml:id="ch03_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")        # set the window background color

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")              # make tess blue
tess.pensize(3)                 # set the width of her pen

tess.forward(50)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(50)

wn.exitonclick()                # wait for a user click on the canvas
            </input>
  </program>
  <p>The last line plays a very important role. The wn variable refers to the window shown
            above. When we invoke its <c>exitonclick</c> method, the program pauses execution and waits for the user to click the mouse somewhere in the window.
            When this click event occurs, the response is to close the turtle window and
            exit (stop execution of) the Python program.</p>
  <p>Each time we run this program, a new drawing window pops up, and will remain on the
            screen until we click on it.</p>

    <p>
      <ol marker="1">
        <li>
          <p>Modify this program so that before it creates the window, it prompts
                        the user to enter the desired background color. It should store the
                        user's responses in a variable, and modify the color of the window
                        according to the user's wishes.
                        (Hint: you can find a list of permitted color names at
                        <url href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp" visual="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp</url>.  It includes some quite

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do similar changes to allow the user, at runtime, to set tess' color.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Do the same for the width of tess' pen.  <em>Hint:</em> your dialog with the

                        expects its argument to be an <c>int</c>.  That means you need to convert
                        the string to an int before you pass it to <c>pensize</c>.

      <image source="PythonTurtle/Figures/TurtleT.png" width="75%"/>
      <p>But the lines are mixed up.  The program should do all necessary set-up, create the turtle, and set the pen size to 10.  After that the turtle should turn to face north, draw a line that is 150 pixels long, turn to face west, and draw a line that is 50 pixels long.  Next, the turtle should turn 180 degrees and draw a line that is 100 pixels long.  Finally, set the window to close when the user clicks in it.</p>
      <p>Drag the blocks of statements from the left column to the right column and put them in the right order.  Then click on <em>Check Me</em> to see if you are right. You will be told if any of the lines are in the wrong order.</p>
