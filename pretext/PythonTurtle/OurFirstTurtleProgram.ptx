    <title>Our First Turtle Program</title>
    <p>Let&#8217;s try a couple of lines of Python code to create a new turtle and
            start drawing a simple figure like a rectangle.
            We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name alex, but remember that you can choose any name you wish as long
            as you follow the naming rules
            from the previous chapter.</p>
    <p>The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the rectangle.
            After line 4 you will have a straight line going from the center of the
            drawing canvas towards the right.  After line 6, you will have a canvas with a
            turtle and a half drawn rectangle.  Press the run button to try it and see.</p>

            <input>
import turtle               # allows us to use the turtles library
wn = turtle.Screen()        # creates a graphics window
alex = turtle.Turtle()      # create a turtle named alex
alex.forward(150)           # tell alex to move forward by 150 units

    </listing>
    <p>Here are a couple of things you&#8217;ll need to understand about this program.</p>
    <p>
        The first line tells Python to load a
        <alert>module</alert>
        named
        <c>turtle</c>
        .  That module
            brings us two new types that we can use: the
        <c>Turtle</c>
        type, and the
        <c>Screen</c>
        type.  The dot notation
        <c>turtle.Turtle</c>
        means
        <em>&#8220;The Turtle type
                that is defined within the turtle module&#8221;</em>
        .   (Remember that Python is case
            sensitive, so the module name,
        <c>turtle</c>
        , with a lowercase
        <title_reference>t</title_reference>
        , is different from the type
        <c>Turtle</c>
        because of the uppercase
        <title_reference>T</title_reference>
        .)
    </p>
    <p>
        We then create and open what the turtle module calls a screen (we would
            prefer to call it a window, or in the case of this web version of Python
            simply a canvas), which we assign to variable
        <title_reference>wn</title_reference>
        . Every window
            contains a
        <alert>canvas</alert>
        , which is the area inside the window on which we can draw.
    </p>
    <p>
        In line 3 we create a turtle. The variable
        <c>alex</c>
        is made to refer to this
            turtle.   These first three lines set us up so that we are ready to do some drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In lines 4-6, we instruct the
        <alert>object</alert>
        <c>alex</c>
        to move and to turn. We do this
            by
        <alert>invoking</alert>
        or activating alex&#8217;s
        <alert>methods</alert>
        &#8212; these are the
            instructions that all turtles know how to respond to.  Here the dot indicates that
            the methods invoked belong to and refer to the object
        <c>alex</c>
        .

    <p>
        An object can have various methods &#8212; things it can do &#8212; and it can also
            have
        <alert>attributes</alert>
        &#8212; (sometimes called
        <em>properties</em>
        ).  For example, each
            turtle has a
        <em>color</em>
        attribute.  The method invocation
        <title_reference>alex.color(&#8220;red&#8221;)</title_reference>
        will make alex red and the line that it draws will be red too.
    </p>
    <p>
        The color of the turtle, the width of its pen(tail), the position of the turtle
            within the window, which way it is facing, and so on are all part of its
            current
        <alert>state</alert>
        .   Similarly, the window object has a background color which is part of its state.
    </p>
    <p>
        Quite a number of attributes and methods exist that allow us to modify the turtle and
            window objects.  In the example below, we show just show a couple and have only commented those
            lines that are different from the previous example.  Note also that we have decided to call our turtle object
        <em>tess</em>
        .
    </p>

    <listing xml:id="ch03_2">
        <caption />
        <program xml:id="ch03_2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
import turtle

wn = turtle.Screen()
wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")        # set the window background color

tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.color("blue")              # make tess blue
tess.pensize(3)                 # set the width of her pen

tess.forward(50)
tess.left(120)
tess.forward(50)

wn.exitonclick()                # wait for a user click on the canvas
        </input>
        </program>
    </listing>
    <p>
        The last line plays a very important role. The wn variable refers to the window shown
            above. When we invoke its
        <c>exitonclick</c>
        method, the program pauses execution and waits for the user to click the mouse somewhere in the window.
            When this click event occurs, the response is to close the turtle window and
            exit (stop execution of) the Python program.
    </p>
    <p>Each time we run this program, a new drawing window pops up, and will remain on the
            screen until we click on it.</p>

                    The period separates the module name from the object name.  The parentheses at the end are what tell Python to invoke a new object.

                    Yes, the Turtle type is defined in the module turtle.  Remember that Python is case sensitive and Turtle is different from turtle.
