      <title>attribute</title>
      <p>Some state or value that belongs to a particular object.  For example,
                            tess has a color.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>canvas</title>
      <p>A surface within a window where drawing takes place.</p>
    </gi>

      <title>control flow</title>
      <p>See <em>flow of execution</em> in the next chapter.</p>

      <title>for loop</title>
      <p>A statement in Python for convenient repetition of statements in
                            the <em>body</em> of the loop.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>instance</title>
      <p>An object that belongs to a class.  tess and alex are different
                            instances of the class Turtle</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>invoke</title>
      <p>An object has methods.  We use the verb invoke to mean <em>activate the
                                method</em>.  Invoking a method is done by putting parentheses after the
                            method name, with some possible arguments.  So  <c>wn.exitonclick()</c> is
                            an invocation of the <c>exitonclick</c> method.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>iteration</title>
      <p>A basic building block for algorithms (programs).  It allows steps to be repeated.  Sometimes called <em>looping</em>.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>loop body</title>
      <p>Any number of statements nested inside a loop. The nesting is indicated
                            by the fact that the statements are indented under the for loop
                            statement.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>loop variable</title>
      <p>A variable used as part of a for loop. It is assigned a different value
                            on each iteration of the loop, and is used as part of the terminating
                            condition of the loop,
                            when it can no longer get a further value.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>method</title>
      <p>A function that is attached to an object.  Invoking or activating the
                            method causes the object to respond in some way, e.g. <c>forward</c> is
                            the method when we say <c>tess.forward(100)</c>.</p>
    </gi>

      <title>module</title>
      <p>A file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in
                            other Python programs. The contents of a module are made available to
                            the other program by using the <em>import</em> statement.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>object</title>
      <p>A <q>thing</q> to which a variable can refer.  This could be a screen window,
                            or one of the turtles you have created.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>range</title>
      <p>A built-in function in Python for generating sequences of integers.  It
                            is especially useful when we need to write a for loop that executes a
                            fixed number of times.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>sequential</title>
      <p>The default behavior of a program.  Step by step processing of algorithm.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>state</title>
      <p>The collection of attribute values that a specific data object maintains.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>terminating condition</title>
      <p>A condition that occurs which causes a loop to stop repeating its body.
                            In the <c>for</c> loops we saw in this chapter, the terminating condition
                            has been when there are no more elements to assign to the loop variable.</p>
    </gi>
    <gi>
      <title>turtle</title>
      <p>A data object used to create pictures (known as turtle graphics).</p>
