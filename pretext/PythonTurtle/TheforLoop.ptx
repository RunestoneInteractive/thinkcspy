  <title>The <c>for</c> Loop</title>
  <video xml:id="forloopvid" youtube="xGSfiZt5cdw" width="auto"/>
  <p>When we drew the square, it was quite tedious.  We had to move then turn, move
            then turn, etc. etc. four times.  If we were drawing a hexagon, or an octogon,
            or a polygon with 42 sides, it would have been a nightmare to duplicate all that code.</p>
  <p>A basic building block of all programs is to be able to repeat some code
            over and over again.  In computer science, we refer to this repetitive idea as <term>iteration</term>.  In this section, we will explore some mechanisms for basic iteration.</p>
  <p>In Python, the <term>for</term> statement allows us to write programs that implement iteration.   As a simple example, let's say we have some friends, and
            we'd like to send them each an email inviting them to our party.  We
            don't quite know how to send email yet, so for the moment we'll just print a
            message for each friend.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch03_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
for name in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", name, "Please come to my party on Saturday!")
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>Take a look at the output produced when you press the <c>run</c> button.  There is one line printed for each friend.  Here's how it works:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><term>name</term> in this <c>for</c> statement is called the <term>loop variable</term>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The list of names in the square brackets is called a Python <term>list</term>.
                    Lists are very useful.  We will have much
                    more to say about them later.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Line 2  is the <term>loop body</term>.  The loop body is always
                    indented. The indentation determines exactly what statements are <q>in the
                    loop</q>.  The loop body is performed one time for each name in the list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On each <em>iteration</em> or <em>pass</em> of the loop, a check is done to see if
                    there are still more items to be processed.  If there are none left (this is
                    called the <term>terminating condition</term> of the loop), the loop has finished.
                    Program execution continues at the next statement after the loop body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If there are items still to be processed, the loop variable is updated to
                    refer to the next item in the list.  This means, in this case, that the loop
                    body is executed here 7 times, and each time <c>name</c> will refer to a different
                    friend.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At the end of each execution of the body of the loop, Python returns
                    to the <c>for</c> statement, to see if there are more items to be handled.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
