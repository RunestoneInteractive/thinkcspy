  <title>List Values</title>
  <p>There are several ways to create a new list.  The simplest is to enclose the
            elements in square brackets ( <c>[</c> and <c>]</c>).</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
[10, 20, 30, 40]
["spam", "bungee", "swallow"]
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three
            strings. As we said above, the elements of a list don't have to be the same type.  The following
            list contains a string, a float, an integer, and
            another list.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
["hello", 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
</input>
  </program>
  <p>A list within another list is said to be <term>nested</term> and the inner list is often called a <term>sublist</term>.
            Finally, there is a special list that contains no elements. It is called the
            empty list and is denoted <c>[]</c>.</p>
  <p>As you would expect, we can also assign list values to variables and pass lists as parameters to functions.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_01" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
vocabulary = ["iteration", "selection", "control"]
numbers = [17, 123]
empty = []
mixedlist = ["hello", 2.0, 5*2, [10, 20]]

print(numbers)
print(mixedlist)
newlist = [ numbers, vocabulary ]
print(newlist)
        </input>
  </program>

                    Yes, unlike strings, lists can consist of any type of Python data.

                    Lists are heterogeneous, meaning they can have different types of data.
