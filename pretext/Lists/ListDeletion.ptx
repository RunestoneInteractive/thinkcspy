  <title>List Deletion</title>
  <p>Using slices to delete list elements can be awkward and therefore error-prone.
            Python provides an alternative that is more readable.
            The <c>del</c> statement removes an element from a list by using its position.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_11" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
a = ['one', 'two', 'three']
del a[1]
print(a)

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del alist[1:5]
print(alist)
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>As you might expect, <c>del</c> handles negative indices and causes a runtime
            error if the index is out of range.
            In addition, you can use a slice as an index for <c>del</c>.
            As usual, slices select all the elements up to, but not including, the second
            index, but do not cause runtime errors if the index limits go too far.</p>
