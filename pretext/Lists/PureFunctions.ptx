  <title>Pure Functions</title>
  <p>A <term>pure function</term> does not produce side effects. It communicates with the
            calling program only through parameters (which it does not modify) and a return
            value. Here is the <c>doubleStuff</c> function from the previous section written as a pure function.
            To use the pure function version of <c>double_stuff</c> to modify <c>things</c>,
            you would assign the return value back to <c>things</c>.
  </p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_mod2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
def doubleStuff(a_list):
    """ Return a new list in which contains doubles of the elements in a_list. """
    new_list = []
    for value in a_list:
        new_elem = 2 * value
        new_list.append(new_elem)
    return new_list

things = [2, 5, 9]
print(things)
things = doubleStuff(things)
print(things)
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>Once again, codelens helps us to see the actual references and objects as they are passed and returned.</p>
