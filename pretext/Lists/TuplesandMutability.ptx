        <title>Tuples and Mutability</title>
        <p>So far you have seen two types of sequential collections: strings, which are made up of
            characters; and lists, which are made up of elements of any type.  One of the
            differences we noted is that the elements of a list can be modified, but the
            characters in a string cannot. In other words, strings are <alert>immutable</alert> and
            lists are <alert>mutable</alert>.</p>
        <p>A <alert>tuple</alert>, like a list, is a sequence of items of any type. Unlike lists,
            however, tuples are immutable. Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated
            sequence of values.  Although it is not necessary, it is conventional to
            enclose tuples in parentheses:</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
julia = ("Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia")
</input></program>
        <p>Tuples are useful for representing what other languages often call <em>records</em> &#8212;
            some related information that belongs together, like your student record.  There is
            no description of what each of these <em>fields</em> means, but we can guess.  A tuple
            lets us &#8220;chunk&#8221; together related information and use it as a single thing.</p>
        <p>Tuples support the same sequence operations as strings and
            lists.
            For example, the index operator selects an element from a tuple.
            A tuple can be the sequence in a for-loop.</p>
        <p>As with strings, if we try to use item assignment to modify one of the elements of the
            tuple, we get an error.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
julia[0] = 'X'
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
</input></program>
        <p>Of course, even if we can&#8217;t modify the elements of a tuple, we can make a variable
            reference a new tuple holding different information.  To construct the new tuple,
            it is convenient that we can slice parts of the old tuple and join up the
            bits to make the new tuple.  So <c>julia</c> has a new recent film, and we might want
            to change her tuple.  We can easily slice off the parts we want and concatenate them with
            the new tuple.</p>

        <p>To create a tuple with a single element (but you&#8217;re probably not likely
            to do that too often), we have to include the final comma, because without
            the final comma, Python treats the <c>(5)</c> below as an integer in parentheses:</p>
