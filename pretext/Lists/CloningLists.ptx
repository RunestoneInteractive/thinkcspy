  <title>Cloning Lists</title>
  <p>If we want to modify a list and also keep a copy of the original, we need to be
            able to make a copy of the list itself, not just the reference. This process is
            sometimes called <term>cloning</term>, to avoid the ambiguity of the word copy.</p>
  <p>The easiest way to clone a list is to use the slice operator.</p>
  <p>Taking any slice of <c>a</c> creates a new list. In this case the slice happens to
            consist of the whole list.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_is4" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <code>
          a = [81, 82, 83]

          b = a[:]       # make a clone using slice
          print(a == b)
          print(a is b)

          b[0] = 5

          print(a)
          print(b)
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>Now we are free to make changes to <c>b</c> without worrying about <c>a</c>.  Again, we can clearly see in codelens that <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> are entirely different list objects.</p>
