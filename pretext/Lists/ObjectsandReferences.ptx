        <title>Objects and References</title>
        <p>If we execute these assignment statements,</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
a = "banana"
b = "banana"
</input></program>
        <p>we know that <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> will refer to a string with the letters
            <c>"banana"</c>. But we don&#8217;t know yet whether they point to the <em>same</em> string.</p>
        <p>There are two possible ways the Python interpreter could arrange its internal states:</p>
        <image source="Lists/Figures/refdiag1.png" alt="List illustration"/>
        <p>or</p>
        <image source="Lists/Figures/refdiag2.png" alt="List illustration"/>
        <p>In one case, <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> refer to two different string objects that have the same
            value. In the second case, they refer to the same object. Remember that an object is something a variable can
            refer to.</p>
        <p>We already know that objects can be identified using their unique identifier.  We can also test whether two names refer to the same object using the <em>is</em>
            operator.  The <em>is</em> operator will return true if the two references are to the same object.  In other words, the references are the same.  Try our example from above.</p>

<listing xml:id="chp09_is1">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="chp09_is1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
a = "banana"
b = "banana"

print(a is b)
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>The answer is <c>True</c>.  This tells us that both <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> refer to the same object, and that it
            is the second of the two reference diagrams that describes the relationship.
            Since strings are <em>immutable</em>, Python can optimize resources by making two names
            that refer to the same string literal value refer to the same object.</p>
        <p>This is not the case with lists.  Consider the following example.  Here, <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> refer to two different lists, each of which happens to have the same element values.</p>

<listing xml:id="chp09_is2">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="chp09_is2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
a = [81, 82, 83]
b = [81, 82, 83]

print(a is b)

print(a == b)
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>The reference diagram for this example looks like this:</p>
        <image source="Lists/Figures/refdiag3.png" alt="Reference diagram for equal different lists"/>
        <p><c>a</c> and <c>b</c> have the same value but do not refer to the same object.</p>
        <p>There is one other important thing to notice about this reference diagram.  The variable <c>a</c> is a reference to a <alert>collection of references</alert>.  Those references actually refer to the integer values in the list.  In other words, a list is a collection of references to objects.  Interestingly, even though <c>a</c> and <c>b</c> are two different lists (two different collections of references), the integer object <c>81</c> is shared by both.  Like strings, integers are also immutable so Python optimizes and lets everyone share the same object for some commonly used small integers.</p>
        <p>Here is the example in codelens.  Pay particular attention to the <title_reference>id</title_reference> values.</p>
