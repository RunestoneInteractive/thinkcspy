                        <p>To create a new object that has the same value as an existing object.
                            Copying a reference to an object creates an alias but doesn&#8217;t clone the
                            object.</p>

                        <p>One of the values in a list (or other sequence). The bracket operator
                            selects elements of a list.</p>

                        <p>A collection of objects, where each object is identified by an index.
                            Like other types <c>str</c>, <c>int</c>, <c>float</c>, etc. there is also a
                            <c>list</c> type-converter function that tries to turn its argument into a
                            list.</p>

                        <p>A function which changes its arguments inside the function body. Only
                            mutable types can be changed by modifiers.</p>

                        <p>A data type in which the elements can be modified. All mutable types
                            are compound types. Lists are mutable data types; strings are not.</p>

                        <p>A sequence of statements, or a style of coding something that has
                            general applicability in a number of different situations.  Part of
                            becoming a mature Computer Scientist is to learn and establish the
                            patterns and algorithms that form your toolkit.  Patterns often
                            correspond to your &#8220;mental chunking&#8221;.</p>

                    <title>pure function</title>
                    
                        <p>A function which has no side effects. Pure functions only make changes
                            to the calling program through their return values.</p>

                        <p>Any of the data types that consist of an ordered collection of elements, with
                            each element identified by an index.</p>

                        <p>A change in the state of a program made by calling a function that is
                            not a result of reading the return value from the function. Side
                            effects can only be produced by modifiers.</p>

                        <p>A sequential collection of items, similar to a list.  Any python object can be an element of a tuple.  However, unlike a list, tuples are immutable.</p>
