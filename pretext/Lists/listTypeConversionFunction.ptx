  <title>List - Type Conversion Function</title>
  <p>Python has a built-in type conversion function called
            <c>list</c> that tries to turn whatever you give it
            into a list.  For example, try the following:</p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_list1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
xs = list("Crunchy Frog")
print(xs)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The string <q>Crunchy Frog</q> is turned into a list by taking each character in the string and placing it in a list.  In general, any sequence can be turned into a list using this function.  The result will be a list containing the elements in the original sequence.  It is not legal to use the <c>list</c> conversion function on any argument that is not a sequence.</p>
  <p>It is also important to point out that the <c>list</c> conversion function will place each element of the original sequence in the new list.  When working with strings, this is very different than the result of the <c>split</c> method.  Whereas <c>split</c> will break a string into a list of <q>words</q>, <c>list</c> will always break it into a list of characters.</p>
