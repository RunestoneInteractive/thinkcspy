  <title>Strings and Lists</title>
  <p>Two of the most useful methods on strings involve lists of
            strings. The <c>split</c> method
            breaks a string into a list of words.  By
            default, any number of whitespace characters is considered a word boundary.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch4_sec11_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
song = "The rain in Spain..."
wds = song.split()
print(wds)

        </input>
  </program>
  <p>An optional argument called a <term>delimiter</term> can be used to specify which
            characters to use as word boundaries.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch4_sec11_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
song = "The rain, and the flood in Spain..."

#These are the same as the default is to split on whitespace:
print(song.split())
print(song.split(' '))

#If we want to split on something else, we can do that too:
abc = song.split(',')
print(abc)
wds = song.split('ai')
print(wds)

# Notice that the split is a string method, so it does not modify the original string.
print(song)

        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Notice that the delimiter doesn't appear in the result.</p>
  <p>The inverse of the <c>split</c> method is <c>join</c>.  You choose a
            desired <term>separator</term> string, (often called the <em>glue</em>)
            and join the list with the glue between each of the elements.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch4_sec11_p3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
wds = ["red", "blue", "green"]
glue = ';'
s = glue.join(wds)
print(s)
print(wds)

print("***".join(wds))
print("".join(wds))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The list that you glue together (<c>wds</c> in this example) is not modified.  Also,
            you can use empty glue or multi-character strings as glue.</p>

  <p>
    <term>index Method in Lists and Strings</term>
  </p>
<p> One important thing to note is that even though index methods work the same in the context of strings and lists, 
  however, they look for different things. In the context of strings, 
  index methods look for a substring (or a character), whereas in the context of lists, index methods look for an element. 
  The following is a great example of how these methods differ, depending on the context. Play with them to see the differences! </p>

<program xml:id="ch4_sec11_p4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>

my_str = "To a great mind, nothing is little,' remarked Holmes, sententiously."
print(my_str.index("great")) # Finds the substring "great" in my_str, expected result is 5
print(my_str.index("m")) # Finds the character "m" in my_str, expected result is 12

    </input>
  </program>
  <p> What happens when I split the string to a list? </p>

<program xml:id="ch4_sec11_p5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
my_str = "To a great mind, nothing is little,' remarked Holmes, sententiously."
my_list = my_str.split() 
print(my_list)
print(my_list.index("great")) # Finds the element "great" in my_list, expected result is 3
print(my_list.index("m")) # "m" is NOT an element in my_list, expected result is -1
    </input>
  </program>

<p> <term> BONUS: </term> Check this example afer reading the next section (List Type Conversion Function) and spot the difference! </p>

<program xml:id="ch4_sec11_p6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
my_str = "To a great mind, nothing is little,' remarked Holmes, sententiously."

char_by_char = list(my_str) 
print(char_by_char)
print(char_by_char.index("m")) # Finds the element "m" in char_by_char, expected result is 12
print(char_by_char.index("great")) # "great" is NOT an element in char_by_char, expected result is -1

        </input>
  </program>

                    Three characters but not the right ones.  namelist is the list of names.

        <feedback>
                    Too many characters in this case.  There should be a single letter from each name.

        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Yes, split creates a list of the three names.  The for loop iterates through the names and creates a string from the first characters.
