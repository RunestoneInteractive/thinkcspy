  <title>Tuples as Return Values</title>
  <p>Functions can return tuples as return values. This is very useful &#x2014; we often want to
            know some batsman's highest and lowest score, or we want to find the mean and the standard
            deviation, or we want to know the year, the month, and the day, or if we're doing
            some ecological modeling we may want to know the number of rabbits and the number
            of wolves on an island at a given time.  In each case, a function (which
            can only return a single value), can create a single tuple holding multiple elements.</p>
  <p>For example, we could write a function that returns both the area and the circumference
            of a circle of radius r.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_tuple3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
def circleInfo(r):
    """ Return (circumference, area) of a circle of radius r """
    c = 2 * 3.14159 * r
    a = 3.14159 * r * r
    return (c, a)

print(circleInfo(10))
        </code>
  </program>
