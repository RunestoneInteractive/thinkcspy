  <title>The Return of L-Systems</title>
  <p>Let's return to the L-systems we introduced in the previous chapter and
            introduce a very interesting new feature that requires the use of lists.</p>
  <p>Suppose we have the following grammar:</p>
  <pre>X
X --&gt; F[-X]+X
F --&gt; FF</pre>
  <p>This L-system looks very similar to the old L-system except that we've added
            one change.  We've added the characters &#x2018;[' and &#x2018;]'.  The meaning of these
            characters adds a very interesting new dimension to our L-Systems.  The &#x2018;['
            character indicates that we want to save the state of our turtle,
            namely its position and its heading so that we can come back to this position
            later.  The &#x2018;]' tells the turtle to warp to the most recently saved position.
            The way that we will accomplish this is to use lists.  We can save the
            heading and position of the turtle as a list of 3 elements.  <c>[heading x
y]</c>  The first index position in the list holds the heading,
            the second index position in the list holds the x coordinate,
            and the third index position holds the y coordinate.</p>
  <p>Now, if we create an empty list and every time we see a &#x2018;[' we append the
            list that contains <c>[heading, x, y]</c> we create a history of saved places
            the turtle has been where the most recently saved location will always be at
            the end of the list.  When we find a &#x2018;]' in the string we use the pop
            function to remove the the most recently appended information.</p>
  <p>Let's modify our <c>drawLsystem</c> function to begin to implement this new
            behavior.</p>
  <program xml:id="list_lsys1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import turtle

def drawLsystem(aTurtle, instructions, angle, distance):
    savedInfoList = []
    for cmd in instructions:
        if cmd == 'F':
            aTurtle.forward(distance)
        elif cmd == 'B':
            aTurtle.backward(distance)
        elif cmd == '+':
            aTurtle.right(angle)
        elif cmd == '-':
            aTurtle.left(angle)
        elif cmd == '[':
            savedInfoList.append([aTurtle.heading(), aTurtle.xcor(), aTurtle.ycor()])
            print(savedInfoList)
        elif cmd == ']':
            newInfo = savedInfoList.pop()
            print(newInfo)
            print(savedInfoList)

t = turtle.Turtle()
inst = "FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X"
drawLsystem(t, inst, 60, 20)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>When we run this example we can see that the picture is not very interesting,
            but notice what gets printed out, and how the saved information about the
            turtle gets added and removed from the end of the list.  In the next example
            we'll make use of the information from the list to save and restore the
            turtle's position and heading when needed.  We'll use a longer example here
            so you get an idea of what the kind of drawing the L-System can really make.</p>
  <program xml:id="list_lsys2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
import turtle

def drawLsystem(aTurtle, instructions, angle, distance):
    savedInfoList = []
    for cmd in instructions:
        if cmd == 'F':
            aTurtle.forward(distance)
        elif cmd == 'B':
            aTurtle.backward(distance)
        elif cmd == '+':
            aTurtle.right(angle)
        elif cmd == '-':
            aTurtle.left(angle)
        elif cmd == '[':
            savedInfoList.append([aTurtle.heading(), aTurtle.xcor(), aTurtle.ycor()])
            print(savedInfoList)
        elif cmd == ']':
            newInfo = savedInfoList.pop()
            aTurtle.setheading(newInfo[0])
            aTurtle.setposition(newInfo[1], newInfo[2])

t = turtle.Turtle()
inst = "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF[-FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF[-FFFFFFFF[-FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFFFFFF[-FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF[-FFFFFFFF[-FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFFFFFF[-FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FFFF[-FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X]+FF[-F[-X]+X]+F[-X]+X"
t.setposition(0, -200)
t.left(90)
drawLsystem(t, inst, 30, 2)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Rather than use the <c>inst</c> string supplied here, use the code from the string
            chapter, and write your own applyRules function to implement this L-system.
            This example only uses 6 expansions.  Try it out with a larger number of
            expansions.  You may also want to try this example with different values for
            the angle and distance parameters.</p>
