  <title>Lists are Mutable</title>
  <p>Unlike strings, lists are <term>mutable</term>.  This means we can change an item in a list by accessing
            it directly as part of the assignment statement. Using the indexing operator (square brackets) on the left side of an assignment, we can
            update one of the list items.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]
print(fruit)

fruit[0] = "pear"
fruit[-1] = "orange"
print(fruit)
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>An
            assignment to an element of a list is called <term>item assignment</term>. Item
            assignment does not work for strings.  Recall that strings are immutable.</p>
  <p>Here is the same example in codelens so that you can step through the statements and see the changes to the list elements.</p>
  <program xml:id="item_assign" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <code>
fruit = ["banana", "apple", "cherry"]

fruit[0] = "pear"
fruit[-1] = "orange"
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>By combining assignment with the slice operator we can update several elements at once.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_8" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
print(alist)
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>We can also remove elements from a list by assigning the empty list to them.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_9" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
alist[1:3] = []
print(alist)
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>We can even insert elements into a list by squeezing them into an empty slice at the
            desired location.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch09_10" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
alist = ['a', 'd', 'f']
alist[1:1] = ['b', 'c']
print(alist)
alist[4:4] = ['e']
print(alist)
    </code>
  </program>

                    Yes, the value True is placed in the list at index 2.  It replaces 8.

        <feedback><p>
                    Item assignment is allowed with lists.  Lists are mutable.
