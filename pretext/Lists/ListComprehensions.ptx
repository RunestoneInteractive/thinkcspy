        <title>List Comprehensions</title>
        <p>The previous example creates a list from a sequence of values based on some selection criteria.  An easy way to do this type of processing in Python is to use a <strong>list comprehension</strong>.  List comprehensions are concise ways to create lists.  The general syntax is:</p>
        <pre>[&lt;expression&gt; for &lt;item&gt; in &lt;sequence&gt; if  &lt;condition&gt;]</pre>
        <p>where the if clause is optional.  For example,</p>

<listing xml:id="listcomp1">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="listcomp1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]

yourlist = [item ** 2 for item in mylist]

print(yourlist)
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
        <p>The expression describes each element of the list that is being built.  The <c>for</c> clause iterates through each item in a sequence.  The items are filtered by the <c>if</c> clause if there is one.  In the example above, the <c>for</c> statement lets <c>item</c> take on all the values in the list <c>mylist</c>.  Each item is then squared before it is added to the list that is being built.  The result is a list of squares of the values in <c>mylist</c>.</p>
        <p>To write the <c>primes_upto</c> function we will use the <c>is_prime</c> function to filter the sequence of integers coming from the <c>range</c> function.  In other words, for every integer from 2 up to but not including <c>n</c>, if the integer is prime, keep it in the list.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
def primes_upto(n):
    """ Return a list of all prime numbers less than n using a list comprehension. """

    result = [num for num in range(2,n) if is_prime(num)]
    return result
</input></program>

        <statement>

        <p>What is printed by the following statements?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
alist = [4,2,8,6,5]
blist = [num*2 for num in alist if num%2==1]
print(blist)
</input></program>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>[4,2,8,6,5]</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Items from alist are doubled before being placed in blist.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>[8,4,16,12,10]</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Not all the items in alist are to be included in blist.  Look at the if clause.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    The result needs to be a list.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice data-correct="yes">
                <statement>
                    <p>[10].</p>

                <feedback>
                    Yes, 5 is the only odd number in alist.  It is doubled before being placed in blist.
