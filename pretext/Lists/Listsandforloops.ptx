  <title>Lists and <c>for</c> loops</title>
  <p>It is also possible to perform <term>list traversal</term> using iteration by item as well as iteration by index.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_03a" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

for afruit in fruits:     # by item
    print(afruit)
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in (the list of) fruits,
            print (the name of the) fruit.</p>
  <p>We can also use the indices to access the items in an iterative fashion.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_03b" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

for position in range(len(fruits)):     # by index
    print(fruits[position])
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>In this example, each time through the loop, the variable <c>position</c> is used as an index into the
            list, printing the <c>position</c>-eth element. Note that we used <c>len</c> as the upper bound on the range
            so that we can iterate correctly no matter how many items are in the list.</p>
  <p>Any sequence expression can be used in a <c>for</c> loop.  For example, the <c>range</c> function returns a sequence of integers.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_for3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
for number in range(20):
    if number % 3 == 0:
        print(number)
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>This example prints all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 19.</p>
  <p>Since lists are mutable, it is often desirable to traverse a list, modifying
            each of its elements as you go. The following code squares all the numbers from <c>1</c> to
            <c>5</c> using iteration by position.</p>
  <program xml:id="chp09_for4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] ** 2

print(numbers)
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>Take a moment to think about <c>range(len(numbers))</c> until you understand how
            it works. We are interested here in both the <em>value</em> and its <em>index</em> within the
            list, so that we can assign a new value to it.</p>

                    There are too many items in this list.  Only 5 append operations are performed.

                    Yes, the for loop processes each item of the list.  5 is added before it is appended to blist.

          <p>Error, you cannot concatenate inside an append.</p>

                    5 is added to each item before the append is performed.
