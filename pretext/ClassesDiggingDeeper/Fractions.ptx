  <title>Fractions</title>
  <p>We have all had to work with fractions when we were younger.  Or, perhaps you do a lot of cooking and have to
            manage measurements for ingredients.  In any case, fractions are something that we are familiar with.
            In this chapter we will develop a class to represent a fraction including some of the most common methods that we
            would like fractions to be able to do.</p>
  <p>A fraction is most commonly thought of as two integers, one over the other, with a line separating them.  The number
            on the top is called the numerator and the number on the bottom is called the denominator.  Sometimes people use a slash
            for the line and sometimes they use a straight line.  The fact is that it really does not matter so long as you know which
            is the numerator and which is the denominator.</p>
  <p>To design our class, we simply need to use the analysis above to realize that the state of a fraction object can be
            completely described by representing two integers.  We can begin by implementing the <c>Fraction</c> class and the <c>__init__</c>
            method which will allow the user to provide a numerator and a denominator for the fraction being created.</p>
  <program xml:id="fractions_init" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
class Fraction:

    def __init__(self, top, bottom):

        self.num = top        # the numerator is on top
        self.den = bottom     # the denominator is on the bottom

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.num) + "/" + str(self.den)

    def getNum(self):
        return self.num

    def getDen(self):
        return self.den

myfraction = Fraction(3, 4)
print(myfraction)

print(myfraction.getNum())
print(myfraction.getDen())
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>Note that the <c>__str__</c> method provides a <q>typical</q> looking fraction using a slash between the numerator and denominator.
            The figure below shows the state of <c>myfraction</c>.  We have also added a few simple accessor methods, <c>getNum</c> and <c>getDen</c>, that can return the
            state values for the fraction.</p>
