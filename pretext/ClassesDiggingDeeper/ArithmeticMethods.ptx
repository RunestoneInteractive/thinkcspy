  <title>Arithmetic Methods</title>
  <p>We will conclude this chapter by adding a few more methods to our <c>Fraction</c> class.  In particular, we will implement
            arithmetic.  To begin, consider what it means to add two fractions together.
            Remember that you can only add fractions if they have the same denominator.  The easiest way to find a common denominator is
            to multiply the two individual denominators together.  Anything we do to the denominator needs to the done to the numerator.  This gives us the following equation for fraction addition:</p>
  <pre>a/b + c/d = (ad + cb)/bd</pre>
  <p>Our <c>add</c> method will take a <c>Fraction</c> as a parameter.  It will return a new <c>Fraction</c> representing the sum.  We
            will use the equation shown above to compute the new numerator and the new denominator.  Since this equation will not
            give us lowest terms, we will utilize a similar technique as was used in the <c>simplify</c> method to find the
            greatest common divisor and then divide each part of the new fraction.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
def add(self,otherfraction):

    newnum = self.num*otherfraction.den + self.den*otherfraction.num
    newden = self.den * otherfraction.den

    common = gcd(newnum,newden)

    return Fraction(newnum//common,newden//common)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>You can try the addition method and then modify the fractions and retry.</p>
  <program xml:id="fractions_add1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def gcd(m, n):
    while m % n != 0:
        oldm = m
        oldn = n

        m = oldn
        n = oldm % oldn

    return n

class Fraction:

    def __init__(self, top, bottom):

        self.num = top        # the numerator is on top
        self.den = bottom     # the denominator is on the bottom

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.num) + "/" + str(self.den)

    def simplify(self):
        common = gcd(self.num, self.den)

        self.num = self.num // common
        self.den = self.den // common

    def add(self,otherfraction):

        newnum = self.num*otherfraction.den + self.den*otherfraction.num
        newden = self.den * otherfraction.den

        common = gcd(newnum, newden)

        return Fraction(newnum // common, newden // common)

f1 = Fraction(1, 2)
f2 = Fraction(1, 4)

f3 = f1.add(f2)
print(f3)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>One final modification to this method will be quite useful.  Instead invoking the <c>add</c> method, we can use the
            addition operator <q>+</q>.  This requires that we implement another special method, this time called <c>__add__</c>.
            The details of the method are the same.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
def __add__(self, otherfraction):

    newnum = self.num*otherfraction.den + self.den*otherfraction.num
    newden = self.den * otherfraction.den

    common = gcd(newnum, newden)

    return Fraction(newnum // common, newden // common)
</input>
  </program>
  <p>However, now we can perform addition in the same manner that we are used to with other numeric data.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
f1 = Fraction(1, 2)
f2 = Fraction(1, 4)

f3 = f1 + f2    # calls the __add__ method of f1
print(f3)
</input>
  </program>
