  <title>Statements and Expressions</title>
  <video xml:id="expression_vid" youtube="3WgmLIsXFkI" width="auto"/>
  <p>A <term>statement</term> is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. We
            have only seen the assignment statement so far.  Some other kinds of statements
            that we'll see shortly are <c>while</c> statements, <c>for</c> statements, <c>if</c>
            statements,  and <c>import</c> statements.  (There are other kinds too!)</p>
  <p xml:id="simple-python-data_index-0">An <term>expression</term> is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls
            to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated.  If you ask Python to <c>print</c> an expression, the interpreter
            <term>evaluates</term> the expression and displays the result.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch02_13" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(1 + 1)
print(len("hello"))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>In this example <c>len</c> is a built-in Python function that returns the number
            of characters in a string.  We've previously seen the <c>print</c> and the
            <c>type</c> functions, so this is our third example of a function!</p>
  <p>The <em>evaluation of an expression</em> produces a value, which is why expressions
            can appear on the right hand side of assignment statements. A value all by
            itself is a simple expression, and so is a variable.  Evaluating a variable gives the value that the variable refers to.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch02_14" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
y = 3.14
x = len("hello")
print(x)
print(y)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>If we take a look at this same example in the Python shell, we will see one of the distinct differences between statements and expressions.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 3.14
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = len("hello")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(y)
3.14
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
3.14
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</input>
  </program>
  <p>Note that when we enter the assignment statement, <c>y = 3.14</c>, only the prompt is returned.  There is no value.  This
            is due to the fact that statements, such as the assignment statement, do not return a value.  They are simply executed.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, the result of executing the assignment statement is the creation of a reference from a variable, <c>y</c>, to a value, <c>3.14</c>.  When we execute the print function working on <c>y</c>, we see the value that y is referring to.  In fact, evaluating <c>y</c> by itself results in the same response.</p>
