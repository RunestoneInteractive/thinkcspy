  <title>Operators and Operands</title>
  <p>
    <term>Operators</term> are special tokens that represent computations like addition,
            multiplication and division. The values the operator works on are called
    <term>operands</term>.
  </p>
  <p>The following are all legal Python expressions whose meaning is more or less
            clear:</p>
  <pre>20 + 32
hour - 1
hour * 60 + minute
minute / 60
5 ** 2
(5 + 9) * (15 - 7)</pre>

<p> Python uses special <c>characters</c> called <c>operators</c> that perform the following operations: </p>
<ul> 
<li> <c> + </c> addition </li>
<li> <c> - </c> subtraction </li>
<li> <c> * </c> multiplication </li>
<li> <c> / </c> division </li>
<li> <c> ** </c> exponentiation </li>
<li> <c> () </c> grouping </li>
<li> <c> // </c> integer division (round down division) </li>
<li> <c> % </c> modulus (remainder) </li>
</ul>

<p> There are several other operators that we will learn in future chapters. But these are the ones that you're going to need more or less all of your assignments! </p>

  <program xml:id="ch2_sec7_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(2 + 3)   # Addition operator, expected result is 5
print(2 - 3)   # Subtraction operator, expected result is -1
print(2 * 3)   # Multiplication operator, expected result is 6
print(5 / 3)   # Division operator, expected result is 1.6666666666666666
print(3 ** 2)  # Exponentiation operator, expected result is 9
print(3*(2+4)) # Grouping operator, changes the precedence expected result is 18 
    </input>
  </program>

<p> First six operators have functionality that you're most probably pretty familiar with! On the other hand we have two more operators that are used frequently in programming but not that much in math classes.
These are integer division, and modulus. </p>

<p> In the previous example <c> 5 / 3 </c> resulted <c> 1.66666666 </c>. This is because <c>/</c> always evaluates to a floating point result. However in certain situations we need integer results for divisions.
Here comes <term>Integer Division</term>,  <c> // </c> which is a division that its results are always rounds down to nearest integer (that's why you can also remember it as round down division). So for the previous example, <c> 5 // 3 </c> will result <c> 1 </c> </p>

<p>The <term>modulus operator</term>, <c> % </c> works on integers (and integer expressions) and yields
            the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second (that's why you can also remember it as remainder operator). For example, <c> 5 % 3 </c> will result <c> 2 </c> as   <c> 5 = 3 * 1 + 2 </c>. 
            The modulus operator can only give values between 0 and second integer minus 1. </p>

  <program xml:id="ch2_sec7_p2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
print(5//3) # Integer division operator, expected result is 1
print(60//7) # Integer division operator, expected result is 8
print(50//2) # Integer division operator works same as division operator when the result is integer

print(5%3) # Modulus operator, expected result is 2
print(60%7) # Modulus operator, expected result is 4

# Modulus operator can only give values between 0 and second integer-1.
print(3%3) # 0
print(4%3) # 1 
print(5%3) # 2 (3-1)
print(6%3) # Again 0!

    </input>
  </program>

   <p xml:id="simple-python-data_index-1">When a variable name appears in the place of an operand, it is replaced with
            the value that it refers to before the operation is performed.
            For example, what if we wanted to convert 645 minutes into hours.
           </p>
  <program xml:id="ch2_sec7_p3" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
minutes = 645
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
    </input>
  </program>
 

 
 
<p>The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can
            check whether one number is divisible by another&#x2014;if <c>x % y</c> is zero, then
    <c>x</c> is divisible by <c>y</c>.
            Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number.  For
            example, <c>x % 10</c> yields the right-most digit of <c>x</c> (in base 10).
            Similarly <c>x % 100</c> yields the last two digits.</p>

 <p>The remainder operator is extremely useful for doing conversions, say from seconds,
            to hours, minutes and seconds.
            If we start with a number of seconds, say 7684, the following program uses integer division and remainder to convert to an easier form.  Step through it to be sure you understand how the division and remainder operators are being used to
            compute the correct values.</p>

  <program xml:id="ch2_sec7_c1" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
          total_secs = 7684
          hours = total_secs // 3600
          secs_still_remaining = total_secs % 3600
          minutes =  secs_still_remaining // 60
          secs_finally_remaining = secs_still_remaining  % 60
    </input>
  </program>
