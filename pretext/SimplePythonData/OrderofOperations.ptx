        <p>When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation
            depends on the <strong>rules of precedence</strong>. Python follows the same precedence
            rules for its mathematical operators that mathematics does.</p>
        <!--The acronym PEMDAS-->
        <!--is a useful way to remember the order of operations:-->
        <p><ol label="1">
            <li>
                <p>Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an
                    expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in
                    parentheses are evaluated first, <c>2 * (3-1)</c> is 4, and <c>(1+1)**(5-2)</c> is
                    8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in
                    <c>(minute * 100) / 60</c>, even though it doesn&#8217;t change the result.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so <c>2**1+1</c> is 3 and
                    not 4, and <c>3*1**3</c> is 3 and not 27.  Can you explain why?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Multiplication and both division operators have the same
                    precedence, which is higher than addition and subtraction, which
                    also have the same precedence. So <c>2*3-1</c> yields 5 rather than 4, and
                    <c>5-2*2</c> is 1, not 6.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Operators with the <emphasis>same</emphasis> precedence (except for <c>**</c>) are
                    evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra we say they are <emphasis>left-associative</emphasis>.
                    So in the expression <c>6-3+2</c>, the subtraction happens first, yielding 3.
                    We then add 2 to get the result 5. If the operations had been evaluated from
                    right to left, the result would have been <c>6-(3+2)</c>, which is 1.</p>
            </li>
        </ol></p>
        <!--(The-->
        <!--acronym PEDMAS could mislead you to thinking that division has higher-->
        <!--precedence than multiplication, and addition is done ahead of subtraction -->
        <!--don't be misled.  Subtraction and addition are at the same precedence, and-->
        <!--the left-to-right rule applies.)-->
        <note>
            <p>An exception to the left-to-right
                left-associative rule is the exponentiation operator <title_reference>**</title_reference>. A useful hint
                is to always use parentheses to force exactly the order you want when
                exponentiation is involved:</p>
