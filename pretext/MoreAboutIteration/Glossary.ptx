                        <p>A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and
                            incremented in the body of a loop.</p>

                        <p>An invisible marker that keeps track of where the next character will
                            be printed.</p>

                    <title>definite iteration</title>
                    
                        <p>A loop where we have an upper bound on the number of times the
                            body will be executed.  Definite iteration is usually best coded
                            as a <c>for</c> loop.</p>

                        <p>An escape character, \, followed by one or more printable characters
                            used to designate a nonprintable character.</p>

                    <title>generalize</title>
                    
                        <p>To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value)
                            with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
                            Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and
                            sometimes even easier to write.</p>

                        <p>A loop where we just need to keep going until some condition is met.
                            A <c>while</c> statement is used for this case.</p>
