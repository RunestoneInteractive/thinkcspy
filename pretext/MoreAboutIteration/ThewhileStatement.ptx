  <title>The <c>while</c> Statement</title>
  <video xml:id="whileloop" youtube="blTBEqybQmQ" width="auto"/>
  <p>There is another Python statement that can also be used to build an iteration.  It is called the <c>while</c> statement.
            The <c>while</c> statement provides a much more general mechanism for iterating.  Similar to the <c>if</c> statement, it uses
            a boolean expression to control the flow of execution.  The body of while will be repeated as long as the controlling boolean expression evaluates to <c>True</c>.
  </p>
  <p>The following figure shows the flow of control.</p>
  <image source="MoreAboutIteration/Figures/while_flow.png" width="50%"/>
  <p>We can use the <c>while</c> loop to create any type of iteration we wish, including anything that we have previously done with a <c>for</c> loop.  For example, the program in the previous section could be rewritten using <c>while</c>.
            Instead of relying on the <c>range</c> function to produce the numbers for our summation, we will need to produce them ourselves.  To to this, we will create a variable called <c>aNumber</c> and initialize it to 1, the first number in the summation.  Every iteration will add <c>aNumber</c> to the running total until all the values have been used.
            In order to control the iteration, we must create a boolean expression that evaluates to <c>True</c> as long as we want to keep adding values to our running total.  In this case, as long as <c>aNumber</c> is less than or equal to the bound, we should keep going.</p>
  <p>Here is a new version of the summation program that uses a while statement.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch07_while1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
def sumTo(aBound):
    """ Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n """

    theSum  = 0
    aNumber = 1
    while aNumber &lt;= aBound:
        theSum = theSum + aNumber
        aNumber = aNumber + 1
    return theSum

print(sumTo(4))

print(sumTo(1000))
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>You can almost read the <c>while</c> statement as if it were in natural language. It means,
            while <c>aNumber</c> is less than or equal to <c>aBound</c>, continue executing the body of the loop. Within
            the body, each time, update <c>theSum</c> using the accumulator pattern and increment <c>aNumber</c>. After the body of the loop, we go back up to the condition of the <c>while</c> and reevaluate it.  When <c>aNumber</c> becomes greater than <c>aBound</c>, the condition fails and flow of control continues to the <c>return</c> statement.</p>
  <p>The same program in codelens will allow you to observe the flow of execution.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch07_while2" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <code>
def sumTo(aBound):
    """ Return the sum of 1+2+3 ... n """

    theSum  = 0
    aNumber = 1
    while aNumber &lt;= aBound:
        theSum = theSum + aNumber
        aNumber = aNumber + 1
    return theSum

print(sumTo(4))
    </code>
  </program>
  <p>More formally, here is the flow of execution for a <c>while</c> statement:</p>
  <p>
    <ol marker="1">
      <li>
        <p>Evaluate the condition, yielding <c>False</c> or <c>True</c>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the condition is <c>False</c>, exit the <c>while</c> statement and continue
                    execution at the next statement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the condition is <c>True</c>, execute each of the statements in the body and
                    then go back to step 1.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>The body consists of all of the statements below the header with the same
            indentation.</p>
  <p>This type of flow is called a <term>loop</term> because the third step loops back around
            to the top. Notice that if the condition is <c>False</c> the first time through the
            loop, the statements inside the loop are never executed.</p>
  <warning>
    <p>Though Python's <c>while</c> is very close to the English <q>while</q>,
                there is an important difference:  In English <q>while X, do Y</q>,
                we usually assume that immediately after X becomes false, we stop
                with Y.  In Python there is <em>not</em> an immediate stop:  After the
                initial test, any following tests come only after the execution of
                the <em>whole</em> body, even if the condition becomes false in the middle of the loop body.</p>
  </warning>
  <p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that
            eventually the condition becomes <c>False</c> and the loop terminates. Otherwise the
            loop will repeat forever. This is called an <term>infinite loop</term>.
            An endless
            source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the
            directions written on the back of the shampoo bottle (lather, rinse, repeat) create an infinite loop.</p>
  <p>In the case shown above, we can prove that the loop terminates because we
            know that the value of <c>aBound</c> is finite, and we can see that the value of <c>aNumber</c>
            increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will have to exceed <c>aBound</c>. In
            other cases, it is not so easy to tell.</p>
  <note>
    <p>Introduction of the while statement causes us to think about the types of iteration we have seen.  The <c>for</c> statement will always iterate through a sequence of values like the list of names for the party or the list of numbers created by <c>range</c>.  Since we know that it will iterate once for each value in the collection, it is often said that a <c>for</c> loop creates a
      <term>definite iteration</term> because we definitely know how many times we are going to iterate.  On the other
                hand, the <c>while</c> statement is dependent on a condition that needs to evaluate to <c>False</c> in order
                for the loop to terminate.  Since we do not necessarily know when this will happen, it creates what we
                call <term>indefinite iteration</term>.  Indefinite iteration simply means that we don't know how many times we will repeat but eventually the condition controlling the iteration will fail and the iteration will stop. (Unless we have an infinite loop which is of course a problem.)</p>
  </note>
  <p>What you will notice here is that the <c>while</c> loop is more work for
            you &#x2014; the programmer &#x2014; than the equivalent <c>for</c> loop.  When using a <c>while</c>
            loop you have to control the loop variable yourself.  You give it an initial value, test
            for completion, and then make sure you change something in the body so that the loop
            terminates.</p>
  <p>So why have two kinds of loop if <c>for</c> looks easier?  The next section, <xref ref="more-about-iteration_randomly-walking-turtles"/>
, shows an indefinite iteration where
            we need the extra power that we get from the <c>while</c> loop.</p>
