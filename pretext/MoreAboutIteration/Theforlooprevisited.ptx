  <title>The <c>for</c> loop revisited</title>
  <p>Recall that the <c>for</c> loop processes each item in a list.  Each item in
            turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable, and the body of the loop is executed.
            We saw this example in an earlier chapter.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch07_for1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
for f in ["Joe", "Amy", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
    print("Hi", f, "Please come to my party on Saturday")
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>We have also seen iteration paired with the update idea to form the accumulator pattern.  For example, to compute
            the sum of the first n integers, we could create a for loop using the <c>range</c> to produce the numbers 1 through n.
            Using the accumulator pattern, we can start with a running total variable initialized to 0 and on each iteration, add the current value of the loop
            variable.  A function to compute this sum is shown below.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch07_summation" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def sumTo(aBound):
    theSum = 0
    for aNumber in range(1, aBound + 1):
        theSum = theSum + aNumber

    return theSum

print(sumTo(4))

print(sumTo(1000))
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>To review, the variable <c>theSum</c> is called the accumulator.  It is initialized to zero before we start the loop.  The loop variable, <c>aNumber</c> will take on the values produced by the <c>range(1, aBound + 1)</c> function call.  Note that this produces all the integers from 1 up to the value of <c>aBound</c>.  If we had not added 1 to <c>aBound</c>, the range would have stopped one value short since <c>range</c> does not include the upper bound.</p>
  <p>The assignment statement, <c>theSum = theSum + aNumber</c>, updates <c>theSum</c> each time through the loop.  This accumulates the running total.  Finally, we return the value of the accumulator.</p>

                    This is how many times the inner loop will print for each iteration of the outer loop.

                    Keep in mind that the inner loop is part of the body of the outer loop.

                    The inner loop will print a total of 15 times; however the outer loop is also printing the same phrase.

                    Correct! The nested loop will be run 3 times, making a total of 18.
