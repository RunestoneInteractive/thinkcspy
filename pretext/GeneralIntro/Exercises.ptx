            This exercise will let you practice displaying information.  Write a program that prints following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name.</li>
            <li>Your favorite color.</li>
            <li>Your favorite word, in double quotes.</li>
            <li>Your favorite poem, at least three lines long (If your favorite poem is longer than ten lines, give only the first three to ten lines.)</li>
            <li>The author of the poem. The name should be indented four spaces and preceded by a hyphen and a space. If you don't know who wrote the poem, use “Anonymous” as the author.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Use complete sentences and blank lines for readability.  To print a blank line, use:</p>
        <program language="python">
            <code>
                print()
            </code>
        </program>

        <p>The parentheses are required, even though there is nothing between them. If you don't believe me, leave them out and see what the output looks like!</p>

        <p>Here is what the output of a possible solution looks like:</p>

        <console><output>
My name is Juana Fulano.
My favorite color is purple.
My favorite word is "giraffe".

My favorite poem:

Greet the dawn,
Rise with the sun.
Rejoice in the sunset
When day is done.
    - Anonymous
    </output></console>
</statement>
    <program interactive="activecode" language="python" xml:id="ch01_ex1_editor">
      <code>

      </code>
    </program>

    <hint>
    <p>You can use either single quotes or double quotes to enclose a string in Python.
        That lets you do something like this:
    </p>
    <program language="python">
        <code>
            print('He said "Hello!" to me.')
        </code>
    </program>
    </hint>
</exercise>
