  <title>A Typical First Program</title>
  <p>Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called <em>Hello,
                World!</em> because all it does is display the words, Hello, World!  In Python, the source code
            looks like this.</p>
  <program language="python">
    <code>
print("Hello, World!")
</code>
  </program>
  <p>This is an example of using the <term>print function</term>, which doesn't actually
            print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the phrase:</p>
  <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
  <p>Here is the example in activecode.  Give it a try!</p>
  <program xml:id="ch01_2" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
print("Hello, World!")
        </code>
  </program>
  <p>The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value.
            They don't appear in the result.</p>
  <p>Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of
            the Hello, World! program. By this standard, Python does about as well as
            possible.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>The print function:</p>
    </statement>
    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>sends information to the printer to be printed on paper.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Within the Python programming language, the print function has nothing to do with the printer.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>displays a value on the screen.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Yes, the print function is used to display the value of the thing being printed.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>tells the computer to put the information in print, rather than cursive, format.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    The format of the information is called its font and has nothing to do with the print function.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>tells the computer to speak the information.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    That would be a different function.
                </p></feedback>
