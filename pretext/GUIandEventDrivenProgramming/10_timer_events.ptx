        <title>Timer Events</title>
        <p>GUI programs run an &#8220;event loop&#8221; that continuously receive events from the
            operating system and &#8220;dispatches&#8221; those events to appropriate callback
            functions. Nothing happens in a GUI program without an event. The application
            logic for some problems requires that specific events happen at some
            specific times. For this reason <c>tkinter</c> includes a feature to generate
            events under software control. These are often refered to as <em>timer events</em>.</p>
        <p>Every widget has an <c>after</c> method that will generate an event at a
            specific time interval from the time it is called. The method takes at
            least 2 arguments: the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
            generating the event, and the callback function to call after the time
            has elapsed. In the example below, the function <c>a_callback_function</c>
            will be called one second (1000 milliseconds) after the timer-event was created.</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
def a_callback_function():
    print("a_callback_function was called.")

my_button = tk.Button(application_window, text="Example")
my_button.after(1000, a_callback_function)
</input></program>
        <subsection xml:id="animations-and-repeated-tasks">
            <title>Animations and Repeated Tasks</title>
            <p>If you want a specific task to be repeated on a regular interval, then
                the callback function that performs the task should create a new timer event
                each time it is called. The following example creates a callback function
                that is called 30 times per second. (Note that 1/30th of a second is 0.033
                seconds, or 33 milliseconds.)</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
def animate():
    # Draw something
    my_button.after(33, animate)

my_button = tk.Button(application_window, text="Example")
my_button.after(33, animate)
</input></program>
            <p>A widget can have more than one timer event active at any time. In fact there
                is no limit to the number of timer events you can create.</p>
            <p>Note that you should never use a loop to repeat a task in a GUI program. If
                you use a loop, the event-loop will be prevented from execution and no
                events will be processed while the loop is running. Always use a timer event
                for repeating a task, especially if a single execution of the task takes
                a considerable amount of CPU time.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="canceling-timer-events">
            <title>Canceling Timer Events</title>
            <p>In some cases you may need to cancel a timer event to prevent it from
                executing. This is straightforward using the <c>after_cancel</c> method.
                Remember that a widget can have multiple active timers, so the
                <c>after_cancel</c> method requires one parameter which specifies which timer
                event to cancel. If you need to cancel an event, you must capture
                the return value from the call to <c>after</c> when you created the event. Here
                is an example:</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
def do_something():
  # Some processing

my_button = tk.Button(application_window, text="Example")
timer_object = my_button.after(1000, do_something)
...

my_button.after_cancel(timer_object)
</input></program>

        <subsection xml:id="multiple-parameters-to-timer-callbacks">
            <title>Multiple Parameters to Timer Callbacks</title>
            <p>Timer callback function can have zero or more arguments passed to them when
                they are called. You specify the arguments when you create the event. This
                makes timer callback functions extremely flexible. Below is an example
                of three different callback functions, each of which receives a different
                number of arguments. You must specify the correct number of arguments for
                the callback function when you create the timer event.</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
def task1():
  # Do some processing

def task2(alpha):
  # Do some processing

def task3(beta, gamma):
  # Do some processing

my_button = tk.Button(application_window, text="Example")
my_button.after(1000, task1)
my_button.after(2000, task2, 3)     # 3 gets passed to the parameter alpha
my_button.after(5000, task3, a, b)  # a gets passed to the parameter beta
                                    # b gets passed to the parameter gamma
</input></program>
