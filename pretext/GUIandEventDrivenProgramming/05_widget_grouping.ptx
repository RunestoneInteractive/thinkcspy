  <title>Widget Groupings</title>
  <p>You will design a more user friendly interface if you group and organize
            your widgets in a coherent design. Tkinter has four basic ways to group
            widgets. These are described in the following table. They are often referred
            to as <q>container</q> widgets because in the widget hierarchy of a GUI program
            they are the parent widget of a group of related widgets.</p>
  <table>
    <tabular>
      <row header="yes">
        <cell>
                            Widget
                        </cell>
        <cell>
                            Purpose
                        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell><c>tk.Frame</c>, <c>ttk.Frame</c></cell>
        <cell>
                            Create a container for a set of widgets to be displayed as a unit.
                        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>
          <c>ttk.LabelFrame</c>
        </cell>
        <cell>
                            Group a number of related widgets using a border and a title.
                        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>
          <c>tk.PanedWindow</c>
        </cell>
        <cell>
                            Group one or more widgets into <q>panes</q>, where the <q>panes</q>
                                can be re-sized by the user by dragging separator lines.
                        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>
          <c>ttk.Notebook</c>
        </cell>
        <cell>
                            A tabbed set of frames, only one of which is visible at any given time.
                        </cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
  </table>
  <p>Widgets are always organized as a hierarchy, where the main
            application window is the root of the hierarchy. Typically, the child widgets
            of an application window are a combination of <q>frames</q>. The <q>frames</q> hold
            other widgets. A <q>frame</q> will not be visible until it is assigned a size
            and location using a layout manager. The image below shows examples of the
            four types of widget <q>containers</q>. The <q>containers</q> in this example used a
            <c>grid</c> layout manager on a 2x2 grid.</p>

  <p>For the <c>Frame</c> and <c>LabelFrame</c> groups, the frame is the <q>parent</q> of the
            widgets displayed inside the frame. That is, when the buttons were created,
            the frame was the first parameter to the <c>tk.Button()</c> function.</p>
  <p>For the <c>PanedWindow</c> and <c>Notebook</c> groups, you use an <c>.add(widget)</c>
            function to add your widgets to the group. You are still creating a hierarchy
            of widgets, but the syntax is different.</p>
  <p>You can download and run this example program, <url href="../_static/Programs/all_frame_widgets.py" visual="../_static/Programs/all_frame_widgets.py">all_frame_widgets.py</url> that allows you to interact
            with the four types of <q>contaners.</q></p>
