        <title>Layout Mangers</title>
        <p>A widget will not be visible in a window until you assign it a size and location
            within it&#8217;s parent widget. Assigning a specific size and location to every widget
            is tedious and error-prone. In addition, the desired behaviour for most GUI
            interfaces is that the widgets resize and relocate in reasonable ways if
            their parent window is re-sized. Trust me, you don&#8217;t what to write code to
            resize and relocate widgets every time you develop a GUI program! Therefore,
            <c>layout managers</c> are included in the Tkinter module to do this work
            for you. You just have to give some basic positioning information to a
            <c>layout manager</c> so it can calculate a position and a size for each widget.</p>
        <p>There are three <c>layout managers</c> in the <c>Tkinter</c> module:</p>
        <table><tabular>
            
                
                
                
                    <row header="yes">
                        <cell>
                            Layout Manager
                        </cell>
                        <cell>
                            Description
                        </cell>
                    </row>
                
                
                    <row>
                        <cell>
                            place
                        </cell>
                        <cell>
                            You specify the exact size and position of each widget.
                        </cell>
                    </row>
                    <row>
                        <cell>
                            pack
                        </cell>
                        <cell>
                            You specify the size and position of each widget <em>relative to each other</em>.
                        </cell>
                    </row>
                    <row>
                        <cell>
                            grid
                        </cell>
                        <cell>
                            You place widgets in a cell of a 2-dimensional table defined by rows and columns.
                        </cell>
                    </row>
                
            
        </tabular></table>
        <p>You should <alert>never</alert> mix and match these layout managers. Use only one of them
            for the widget layout within a particular &#8220;parent widget&#8221;. (Widgets are organized
            in a hierarchy, which is explained in the next lesson.)</p>
