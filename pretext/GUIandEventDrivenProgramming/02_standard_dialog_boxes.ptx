        <title>Tkinter Standard Dialog Boxes</title>
        <p>There are many common programming tasks that can be performed using
            pre-defined GUI dialog boxes. The following discussion describes these
            dialog boxes and provides some simple examples. You can refer to the
            Python documentation for additional optional parameters.</p>
        <subsection xml:id="messages">
            <title>Messages</title>
            <p>A <c>messagebox</c> can display information to a user.
                There are three variations on these dialog boxes based on the type
                of message you want to display. The functions&#8217; first parameter gives a
                name for the dialog box which is displayed in the window&#8217;s header. The
                second parameter is the text of the message. The functions return a string
                which is typically ignored.</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
from tkinter import messagebox

messagebox.showinfo("Information","Informative message")
messagebox.showerror("Error", "Error message")
messagebox.showwarning("Warning","Warning message")
</input></program>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="yes-no-questions">
            <title>Yes/No Questions</title>
            <p>The tkinter <c>messagebox</c> object also allows you to ask a user simple yes/no
                type questions and varies the button names based on the type of question.
                These functions are:</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
from tkinter import messagebox

answer = messagebox.askokcancel("Question","Do you want to open this file?")
answer = messagebox.askretrycancel("Question", "Do you want to try that again?")
answer = messagebox.askyesno("Question","Do you like Python?")
answer = messagebox.askyesnocancel("Question", "Continue playing?")
</input></program>
            <p>The return value is a Boolean, True or False, answer to the question. If
                &#8220;cancel&#8221; is an option and the user selects the &#8220;cancel&#8221; button, <c>None</c>
                is returned.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="single-value-data-entry">
            <title>Single Value Data Entry</title>
            <p>If you want to ask the user for a single data value, either a string, integer,
                or floating point value, you can use a <c>simpledialog</c> object. A user can
                enter the requested value and hit &#8220;OK&#8221;, which will return the entered value.
                If the user hits &#8220;Cancel,&#8221; then <c>None</c> is returned.</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import simpledialog

application_window = tk.Tk()

answer = simpledialog.askstring("Input", "What is your first name?",
                                parent=application_window)
if answer is not None:
    print("Your first name is ", answer)
else:
    print("You don't have a first name?")

answer = simpledialog.askinteger("Input", "What is your age?",
                                 parent=application_window,
                                 minvalue=0, maxvalue=100)
if answer is not None:
    print("Your age is ", answer)
else:
    print("You don't have an age?")

answer = simpledialog.askfloat("Input", "What is your salary?",
                               parent=application_window,
                               minvalue=0.0, maxvalue=100000.0)
if answer is not None:
    print("Your salary is ", answer)
else:
    print("You don't have a salary?")
</input></program>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="file-chooser">
            <title>File Chooser</title>
            <p>A common task is to select the names of folders and files on a storage device.
                This can be accomplished using a <c>filedialog</c> object. Note that these commands
                do not save or load a file. They simply allow a user to select a file. Once
                you have the file name, you can open, process, and close the file using
                appropriate Python code. These dialog boxes always return you a
                &#8220;fully qualified file name&#8221; that includes a full path to the file.
                Also note that if a user is allowed to select multiple files, the return
                value is a tuple that contains all of the selected files. If a user cancels
                the dialog box, the returned value is an empty string.</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import os

application_window = tk.Tk()

# Build a list of tuples for each file type the file dialog should display
my_filetypes = [('all files', '.*'), ('text files', '.txt')]

# Ask the user to select a folder.
answer = filedialog.askdirectory(parent=application_window,
                                 initialdir=os.getcwd(),
                                 title="Please select a folder:")

# Ask the user to select a single file name.
answer = filedialog.askopenfilename(parent=application_window,
                                    initialdir=os.getcwd(),
                                    title="Please select a file:",
                                    filetypes=my_filetypes)

# Ask the user to select a one or more file names.
answer = filedialog.askopenfilenames(parent=application_window,
                                     initialdir=os.getcwd(),
                                     title="Please select one or more files:",
                                     filetypes=my_filetypes)

# Ask the user to select a single file name for saving.
answer = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(parent=application_window,
                                      initialdir=os.getcwd(),
                                      title="Please select a file name for saving:",
                                      filetypes=my_filetypes)

        <subsection xml:id="color-chooser">
            <title>Color Chooser</title>
            <p>Tkinter includes a nice dialog box for choosing colors. You provide it with
                a parent window and an initial color, and it returns a color in two different
                specifications: 1) a RGB value as a tuple, such as <c>(255, 0, 0)</c> which
                represents red, and 2) a hexadecimal string used in web pages, such
                as <c>"#FF0000"</c> which also represents red. If the user cancels the
                operation, the return values are <c>None</c> and <c>None</c>.</p>
            <program language="python"><input>
from tkinter import colorchooser

rgb_color, web_color = colorchooser.askcolor(parent=application_window,
                                             initialcolor=(255, 0, 0))
</input></program>
