        <title>Command Events</title>
        <p>When a user clicks on certain types of widgets, like a button, you typically
            want a specific action to be performed.
            This is accomplished by setting the <c>command</c> attribute of a widget to a
            specific <c>event handler</c> function. This can be any function that receives
            no arguments as parameters. You can set the <c>event handler</c> function using
            a &#8220;named parameter&#8221; when you create the widget, or set the widget&#8217;s <c>command</c>
            attribute using a dictionary lookup. For example:</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
def my_function():
  print("my_function was called.")

my_button = tk.Button(application_window, text="Example", command=my_function)

# or

my_button = tk.Button(application_window, text="Example")
my_button['command'] = my_function
</input></program>
        <p>Note that you are setting the <c>command</c> property of the widget to a
            <emphasis>function reference</emphasis> &#8211; you are not calling the function! Therefore, do not
            put parentheses after the function name when you make the assignment.</p>
        <p>The following widgets define a <c>command</c> property which defines a function
            that is called from the application&#8217;s event loop whenever a specific, predefined
            event is performed by a user.</p>

                            The user event that causes the <c>command</c> function to be executed:

                        <cell>
                            The user places their pointing device cursor over the button and
                                presses and releases the left mouse button. The function is
                                actually called on the button release.

                        <cell>
                            The function is called if the slider moves. The function is passed
                                one argument, the new scale value.
