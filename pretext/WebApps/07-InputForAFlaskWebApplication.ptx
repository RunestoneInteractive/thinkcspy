        <title>Input For A Flask Web Application</title>
        <p>In this section, we will design a web application that obtains input from
            the user. In the example in this section, the user must encode the input directly
            into the URL. In the next section, we&#8217;ll provide a more user-friendly approach
            for obtaining input.</p>
        <p>The URL used to interact with a web application can contain input data in addition to the
            path. This input data is typically encoded into the URL in the form of a query string.
            Here&#8217;s an example of a URL containing a query string:</p>
        <block_quote>
            <p><url href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=python+flask&amp;go=Submit" visual="http://www.bing.com/search?q=python+flask&amp;go=Submit">http://www.bing.com/search?q=python+flask&amp;go=Submit</url></p>
        </block_quote>
        <p>The query string is the portion that comes after the ? symbol:</p>
        <pre>q=python+flask&amp;go=Submit</pre>
        <p>It contains a set of query variables and values, each query variable/value pair separated
            from the others by the &amp; symbol. This example has a query variable named <c>q</c> whose value is
            <em>python+flask</em>, and a variable named <c>go</c> whose value is <em>Submit</em>.</p>
        <p>Flask applications can access query variables using a dictionary named
            <c>request.args</c> (dictionaries are discussed in detail in
            <xref ref="../Dictionaries/intro-Dictionaries#dictionaries"/>).
            When a browser sends a request to a Flask application that contains
            a query string, the data in the query string is placed in the <c>request.args</c>
            dictionary, where it can be retrieved by the application. For example, in the Bing search
            URL above, if Bing were a Flask application, it could access the values in the query string
            like this:</p>
        <pre>q = request.args['q']
go = request.args['go']</pre>
        <p>This would retrieve the values &#8216;python flask&#8217; and &#8216;Submit&#8217; from the query string and store them,
            respectively, in <c>q</c> and <c>go</c>.</p>
        <p>Here is an enhanced version of the original flaskhello.py program that gets the user&#8217;s name
            from the query string and uses it to greet the user:</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
 from flask import Flask, request
 from datetime import datetime

 app = Flask(__name__)

 @app.route('/')
 def hello():
     name = request.args['name']
     return HELLO_HTML.format(
             name, str(datetime.now()))

 HELLO_HTML = """
     &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
         &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {0}!&lt;/h1&gt;
         The time is {1}.
     &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"""

 if __name__ == "__main__":
     # Launch the Flask dev server
     app.run(host="localhost", debug=True)
</input></program>
        <p>To test this example, you would need to enter the following URL into the browser:</p>
        <block_quote>
            <p><url href="http://localhost:5000/?name=Frank" visual="http://localhost:5000/?name=Frank">http://localhost:5000/?name=Frank</url></p>
        </block_quote>
        <p>If the name parameter is omitted, the application will crash when it attempts to
            retrieve the query parameter from the dictionary, because indexing a dictionary
            with a key that is not present in the dictionary is illegal.
            To make the application more robust, we could change line 8 to
            check to see if the name parameter was submitted:</p>
        <pre>if 'name' in request.args:
    name = request.args['name']
else:
    name = 'World'</pre>
        <p>The test <c>'name' in request.args</c> is True if &#8216;name&#8217;
            was present in the query parameters, and False if not.</p>
        <p>A shorter way to handle a missing query parameter is to use the
            dictionary <c>get()</c> method, which allows us to supply a default value to use in
            case the user omits the query parameter. The if statement above could be
            rewritten with a single line of code:</p>
        <pre>name = request.args.get('name', 'World')</pre>
        <p>This line does the same check as the if statement. If &#8216;name&#8217; is present
            in the query parameters, its value is stored in <c>name</c>. Otherwise, the value
            &#8216;World&#8217; is stored in <c>name</c> if no name parameter was supplied.</p>
