  <title>Web Applications and HTML Forms</title>
  <p>Perhaps you're thinking, <q>I don't usually perform searches by typing in URL's &#x2014; I fill out a search form.</q>
            True &#x2014; if web applications forced users to interact with them by entering query strings, the World-Wide
            Web would be a much less popular place.</p>
  <p>Let's explore the relationship between forms and query strings a bit. Bring up the Google home page (I'll wait):</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <url href="https://google.com" visual="https://google.com">https://google.com</url>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, type in your query. When I type in <q>Microsoft</q> and click Search, here is what I see:</p>

  </figure>
  <p>Now, take a good look at the URL in the title bar &#x2014; notice the query string? It's a bit more complicated
            than the one I had you create by hand earlier. But you can probably pick out the <q>q=Microsoft</q> if you
            look closely. How did all of that get there? Well, when you clicked Search, the browser took the information
            you typed into the form, packaged it up into a query string, and transmitted it to the Google web
            server. You see, when you fill out a form on a web page and click Submit, the browser uses the form
            data to construct a URL, and then sends a normal request to the web server.</p>
  <p>Even if you're a novice at writing <term>HTML pages</term>, it's not hard to learn to create HTML forms. Take a look
            at this simplified version of the Google home page:</p>
  <program language="html">
    <code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Google&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div align="center"&gt;
    &lt;img src="https://www.google.com/images/logo.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;form action="https://google.com/search"&gt;
      Enter your search words: &lt;input type="text" name="q"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" name="btnG" value="Google Search"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
  </program>
  <p>Focus on the region of this example in between the &lt;form&gt; tags. Here's a quick overview of this part
            of the page:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The form is the region of the page in between the &lt;form&gt; and &lt;/form&gt; tags.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The form can contain a mixture of text, regular HTML formatting tags, and form &lt;input&gt; tags</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Each <c>&lt;input&gt;</c> tag has a <c>type</c> and a <c>name</c> attribute. The <c>type</c> attribute specifies what kind of input area
                    it is (<q>text</q> for a text box, <q>submit</q> for submit button, etc.). The <c>name</c> attribute specifies a name for
                    the input area.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the user fills out the form and clicks the submit button, the browser constructs a URL by taking
                    the form's <c>action</c> attribute (<url href="https://google.com/search" visual="https://google.com/search">https://google.com/search</url>), appending a ?, and constructing the
                    query string using the names of the form input areas, together with the data entered by the user.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Try it out! Using Notepad, type in this example, and save it as googleform.html. Open it in your browser;
            you should see something like this:</p>
  <figure align="">
    <image source="WebApps/Figures/googleform.png" width="50%"/>
  </figure>
  <p>Fill out the form, and, if Google still works as it did when this chapter was written, you should see
            search results appear in your browser.</p>
