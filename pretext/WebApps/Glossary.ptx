                        <p>programs that are downloaded to a web browser and executed on the user&#8217;s local machine. Client-side applications are typically written in JavaScript and embedded in web pages.</p>

                    <title>Server-side web applications</title>
                    
                        <p>programs that run on web server computers, rather than on the user&#8217;s local machine. Typically, a server-side web application displays a form with text boxes and other data collection mechanisms. The user fills out the form, clicks a submit button, and the browser sends the form to the web application on the server, which processes the request, and responds with another web page.</p>
