        <title>Conditional Execution: Binary Selection</title>

    <video xml:id="HriDtn-0Dcw" youtube="HriDtn-0Dcw" width="560"/>
            <p>In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check
            conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. <alert>Selection statements</alert>, sometimes
            also referred to as <alert>conditional statements</alert>, give us this ability. The simplest form of selection is the <alert>if statement</alert>.
            This is sometimes referred to as <alert>binary selection</alert> since there are two possible paths of execution.</p>

        <input>
x = 15

if x % 2 == 0:

        <p>The syntax for an <c>if</c> statement looks like this:</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENTS_1        # executed if condition evaluates to True
else:
    STATEMENTS_2        # executed if condition evaluates to False
</input></program>
        <p>The boolean expression after the <c>if</c> statement is called the <alert>condition</alert>.
            If it is true, then the immediately following indented statements get executed. If not, then the statements
            indented under the <c>else</c> clause get executed.</p>

            <image source="Selection/Figures/flowchart_if_else.png"/>
        </sidebar>
        <p>As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound
            statements like <c>for</c>, the <c>if</c> statement consists of a header line and a body. The header
            line begins with the keyword <c>if</c> followed by a <em>boolean expression</em> and ends with
            a colon (:).</p>
        <p>The more indented statements that follow are called a <alert>block</alert>.</p>
        <p>Each of the statements inside the first block of statements is executed in order if the boolean
            expression evaluates to <c>True</c>. The entire first block of statements
            is skipped if the boolean expression evaluates to <c>False</c>, and instead
            all the statements under the <c>else</c> clause are executed.</p>
        <p>There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of an
            <c>if</c> statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.</p>
        <p>Each compound statement includes a heading and all the following further-indented statements in
            the block after the heading.  The <c>if</c> - <c>else</c> statement is an unusual compound statement because it
            has more than one part at the same level of indentation as the <c>if</c> heading,
            (the <c>else</c> clause, with its own indented block).</p>

    <exercise xml:id="test_question6_4_2">
        <statement>

        <p>What does the following code print (choose from output a, b, c or nothing)?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
if 4 + 5 == 10:
    print("TRUE")
else:
    print("FALSE")
</input></program>

            <choice>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    TRUE is printed by the if-block, which only executes if the conditional (in this case, 4+5 == 10) is true.  In this case 5+4 is not equal to 10.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice correct="yes">

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Since 4+5==10 evaluates to False, Python will skip over the if block and execute the statement in the else block.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Python would never print both TRUE and FALSE because it will only execute one of the if-block or the else-block, but not both.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Python will always execute either the if-block (if the condition is true) or the else-block (if the condition is false).  It would never skip over both blocks.

    <exercise xml:id="test_question6_4_3">
        <statement>

        <p>What does the following code print?</p>
        <program language="python"><input>
if 4 + 5 == 10:
    print("TRUE")
else:
    print("FALSE")

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Although TRUE is printed after the if-else statement completes, both blocks within the if-else statement print something too.  In this case, Python would have had to have skipped both blocks in the if-else statement, which it never would do.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>Output b</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Because there is a TRUE printed after the if-else statement ends, Python will always print TRUE as the last statement.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice correct="yes">

                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Python will print FALSE from within the else-block (because 5+4 does not equal 10), and then print TRUE after the if-else statement completes.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>Output d</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    To print these three lines, Python would have to execute both blocks in the if-else statement, which it can never do.
