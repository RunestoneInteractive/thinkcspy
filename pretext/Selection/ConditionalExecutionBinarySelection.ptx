  <title>Conditional Execution: Binary Selection</title>
  <video xml:id="HriDtn-0Dcw" youtube="HriDtn-0Dcw" width="auto"/>
  <p>In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check
            conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. <term>Selection statements</term>, sometimes
            also referred to as <term>conditional statements</term>, give us this ability. The simplest form of selection is the <term>if statement</term>.
            This is sometimes referred to as <term>binary selection</term> since there are two possible paths of execution.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch05_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
x = 15

if x % 2 == 0:
    print(x, "is even")
else:
    print(x, "is odd")
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>The syntax for an <c>if</c> statement looks like this:</p>
  <program language="python">
    <input>
if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENTS_1        # executed if condition evaluates to True
else:
    STATEMENTS_2        # executed if condition evaluates to False
</input>
  </program>
  <p>The boolean expression after the <c>if</c> statement is called the <term>condition</term>.
            If it is true, then the immediately following indented statements get executed. If not, then the statements
            indented under the <c>else</c> clause get executed.</p>

  </sidebar>
  <p>As with the function definition from the last chapter and other compound
            statements like <c>for</c>, the <c>if</c> statement consists of a header line and a body. The header
            line begins with the keyword <c>if</c> followed by a <em>boolean expression</em> and ends with
            a colon (:).</p>
  <p>The more indented statements that follow are called a <term>block</term>.</p>
  <p>Each of the statements inside the first block of statements is executed in order if the boolean
            expression evaluates to <c>True</c>. The entire first block of statements
            is skipped if the boolean expression evaluates to <c>False</c>, and instead
            all the statements under the <c>else</c> clause are executed.</p>
  <p>There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear under the two clauses of an
            <c>if</c> statement, but there has to be at least one statement in each block.</p>
  <p>Each compound statement includes a heading and all the following further-indented statements in
            the block after the heading.  The <c>if</c> - <c>else</c> statement is an unusual compound statement because it
            has more than one part at the same level of indentation as the <c>if</c> heading,
            (the <c>else</c> clause, with its own indented block).</p>

    <statement>
      <p>What does the following code print (choose from output a, b, c or nothing)?</p>
      <program language="python">
        <input>
if 4 + 5 == 10:

          <p>TRUE</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    TRUE is printed by the if-block, which only executes if the conditional (in this case, 4+5 == 10) is true.  In this case 5+4 is not equal to 10.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>FALSE</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Since 4+5==10 evaluates to False, Python will skip over the if block and execute the statement in the else block.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>TRUE on one line and FALSE on the next</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Python would never print both TRUE and FALSE because it will only execute one of the if-block or the else-block, but not both.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>Nothing will be printed</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Python will always execute either the if-block (if the condition is true) or the else-block (if the condition is false).  It would never skip over both blocks.

        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Although TRUE is printed after the if-else statement completes, both blocks within the if-else statement print something too.  In this case, Python would have had to have skipped both blocks in the if-else statement, which it never would do.
                </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>

        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Because there is a TRUE printed after the if-else statement ends, Python will always print TRUE as the last statement.
                </p></feedback>

      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement>
          <p>Output c</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    Python will print FALSE from within the else-block (because 5+4 does not equal 10), and then print TRUE after the if-else statement completes.

        <statement>

        </statement>
        <feedback><p>
                    To print these three lines, Python would have to execute both blocks in the if-else statement, which it can never do.
