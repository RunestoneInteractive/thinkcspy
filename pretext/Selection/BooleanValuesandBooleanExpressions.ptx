    <title>Boolean Values and Boolean Expressions</title>

    <p>
        The Python type for storing true and false values is called
        <c>bool</c>
        , named
            after the British mathematician, George Boole. George Boole created
        <em>Boolean
                Algebra</em>
        , which is the basis of all modern computer arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are only two
        <alert>boolean values</alert>
        .  They are
        <c>True</c>
        and
        <c>False</c>
        .  Capitalization
            is important, since
        <c>true</c>
        and
        <c>false</c>
        are not boolean values (remember Python is case
            sensitive).

    <note>
        <p>Boolean values are not strings!</p>
        <p>
            It is extremely important to realize that True and False are not strings.   They are not
                surrounded by quotes.  They are the only two values in the data type
            <c>bool</c>
            .  Take a close look at the
                types shown below.

        A
        <alert>boolean expression</alert>
        is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.
            The equality operator,
        <c>==</c>
        , compares two values and produces a boolean value related to whether the
            two values are equal to one another.

        <caption />
        <program xml:id="ch05_2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
            <input>
print(5 == 5)

print(5 == 6)

j = "hel"
print(j + "lo" == "hello")
        </input>
        </program>
    </listing>
    <p>
        In the first statement, the two operands are equal, so the expression evaluates
            to
        <c>True</c>
        .  In the second statement, 5 is not equal to 6, so we get
        <c>False</c>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        <c>==</c>
        operator is one of six common
        <alert>comparison operators</alert>
        ; the others are:
    </p>
    <program language="python">
        <input>
x != y               # x is not equal to y
x &gt; y                # x is greater than y
x &lt; y                # x is less than y
x &gt;= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
x &lt;= y               # x is less than or equal to y
</input>
    </program>
    <p>
        Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are
            different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single
            equal sign (
        <c>=</c>
        ) instead of a double equal sign (
        <c>==</c>
        ). Remember that
        <c>=</c>
        is an assignment operator and
        <c>==</c>
        is a comparison operator. Also, there is
            no such thing as
        <c>=&lt;</c>
        or
        <c>=&gt;</c>
        .
    </p>
    <!--With reassignment it is especially important to distinguish between an-->
    <!--assignment statement and a boolean expression that tests for equality.-->
    <!--Because Python uses the equal token (``=``) for assignment,-->
    <!--it is tempting to interpret a statement like-->
    <!--``a = b`` as a boolean test.  Unlike mathematics, it is not!  Remember that the Python token-->
    <!--for the equality operator is ``==``.-->
    <p>
        Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For example,
            if
        <c>a == 7</c>
        then
        <c>7 == a</c>
        . But in Python, the statement
        <c>a = 7</c>
        is legal and
        <c>7 = a</c>
        is not. (Can you explain why?)

    <exercise xml:id="test_question6_1_1">
        <statement>

            <p>Which of the following is a Boolean expression?  Select all that apply.</p>

        </statement>
        <choices>

            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>
                    <p>True</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    True and False are both Boolean literals.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>
                    <p>3 == 4</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    The comparison between two numbers via == results in either True or False (in this case False),  both Boolean values.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>3 + 4</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    3 + 4 evaluates to 7, which is a number, not a Boolean value.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>
                    <p>3 + 4 == 7</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    3 + 4 evaluates to 7.  7 == 7 then evaluates to True, which is a Boolean value.
                </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>"False"</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    With the double quotes surrounding it, False is interpreted as a string, not a Boolean value.  If the quotes had not been included, False alone is in fact a Boolean value.
                </feedback>
            </choice>
        </choices>
