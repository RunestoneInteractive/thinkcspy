  <p>Another form of the <c>if</c> statement is one in which the <c>else</c> clause is omitted entirely.
            This creates what is sometimes called <term>unary selection</term>.
            In this case, when the condition evaluates to <c>True</c>, the statements are
            executed.  Otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the body of the <c>if</c>.</p>

        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    Because -10 is less than 0, Python will execute the body of the if-statement here.

                    Python executes the body of the if-block as well as the statement that follows the if-block.

        <statement>

        <feedback>
                    Python will also execute the statement that follows the if-block (because it is not enclosed in an else-block, but rather just a normal statement).

          <p>It will cause an error because every if must have an else clause.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
                    It is valid to have an if-block without a corresponding else-block (though you cannot have an else-block without a corresponding if-block).

                    Every else-block must have exactly one corresponding if-block.  If you want to chain if-else statements together, you must use the else if construct, described in the chained conditionals section.

                    This will cause an error because the second else-block is not attached to a corresponding if-block.
