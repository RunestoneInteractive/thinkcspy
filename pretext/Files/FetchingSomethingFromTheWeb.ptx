  <title>Fetching Something From The Web</title>
  <p>The Python libraries are pretty messy in places. But here is a very simple example that copies
            the contents at some web URL to a local file. We will need to get a few things right before this works:</p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The resource we're trying to fetch must exist! Check this using a browser.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We'll need permission to write to the destination filename, and the file will be created in the <q>current directory</q> - i.e. the same folder that the Python program is saved in.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we are behind a proxy server that requires authentication, (as some students are), this may require some more special handling to work around our proxy. Use a local resource for the purpose of this demonstration!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>We will try to retrieve the content of the HTML of this page as in the following code.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch11_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <code>
import urllib.request

def retrieve_page(url):
    """ Retrieve the contents of a web page.
    """
    my_socket = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    dta = my_socket.read()
    return dta

the_text = retrieve_page("https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Files/FetchingSomethingFromTheWeb.html")
print(the_text)
        </code>
  </program>
