  <p>In addition to the <c>for</c> loop, Python provides three methods to read data
            from the input file. The <c>readline</c> method reads one line from the file and
            returns it as a string. The string returned by <c>readline</c> will contain the
            newline character at the end. This method returns the empty string when it
            reaches the end of the file. The <c>readlines</c> method returns the contents of
            the entire file as a list of strings, where each item in the list represents
            one line of the file. It is also possible to read the entire file into a
            single string with <c>read</c>. <xref ref="files_filemethods2a"/> summarizes these methods
            and the following session shows them in action.</p>
  <p>Note that we need to reopen the file before each read so that we start from
            the beginning. Each file has a marker that denotes the current read position
            in the file. Any time one of the read methods is called the marker is moved to
            the character immediately following the last character returned. In the case
            of <c>readline</c> this moves the marker to the first character of the next line
            in the file. In the case of <c>read</c> or <c>readlines</c> the marker is moved to
            the end of the file.</p>

  <p>Now let's look at another method of reading our file using a <c>while</c> loop.  This is important because many other programming languages do not support the <c>for</c> loop style for reading files but they do support the pattern we'll show you here.</p>
  <program xml:id="ch11_sec5_p1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
infile = open("ccdata.txt", "r")
line = infile.readline()
while line:
    values = line.split()
    print('In', values[0], 'the average temp. was', values[1], '&#xB0;C and CO2 emmisions were', values[2], 'gigatons.')
    line = infile.readline()

infile.close()
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>There are several important things to notice in this code:</p>
  <p>On line 2 we have the statement <c>line = infile.readline()</c>.
            We call this initial read the <term>priming read</term>.
            It is very important because the while condition needs to have a value for the <c>line</c> variable.</p>
  <p>The <c>readline</c> method will return the
            empty string if there is no more data in the file.
            An empty string is an empty sequence of characters.
            When Python is looking for a Boolean condition, as in <c>while line:</c>,
            it treats an empty sequence type as <c>False</c>, and a non-empty sequence as <c>True</c>.
            Remember that a
            blank line in the file actually has a single character, the <c>\n</c> character (newline).
            So, the only way that a line of data from the
            file can be empty is if you are reading at the end of the file, and the <c>while</c> condition becomes <c>False</c>.</p>
  <p>Finally, notice that the last line of the body of the <c>while</c> loop performs another <c>readline</c>.  This statement will reassign the variable <c>line</c> to the next line of the file.  It represents the <title_reference>change of state</title_reference> that is necessary for the iteration to
            function correctly.  Without it, there would be an infinite loop processing the same line of data over and over.</p>
