  <title>Letter Count Histogram</title>
  <p>The previous lab wrote a function to return a dictionary of letter counts.  In an earlier chapter, we wrote a turtle
            program that could draw a histogram.</p>
  <p>Combine these two ideas together to create a function that will take a string and create a histogram of the number of
            times each letter occurs.  Make sure it is in alphabetical order from left to right.</p>
  <p>
    <ol label="1">
      <li>
        <p>Count the number of times each letter occurs.  Keep the count in a dictionary.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Get the keys from the dictionary, convert them to a list, and sort them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Iterate through the keys, in alphabetical order, getting the associated value (count).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make a histogram bar for each.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
