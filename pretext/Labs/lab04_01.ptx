  <title>Drawing a Circle</title>
  <p>In this lesson we are going to develop a function that uses a turtle to draw
            a circle.  As we develop this function we will investigate several problem
            solving strategies that illustrate how computer scientists think as they
            solve problems.</p>
  <p>In figuring out how to write this function we must realize that there are
            some limitations of our ability to draw a circle.  First,
            we are limited by the turtle functions we already know about, for example,
            left, right, forward.  There is not a method for drawing a curved line with a
            turtle (well, actually there is, but we're not going to use it).</p>
  <p>One of the first strategies we will employ is called <em>simplification</em>.  Let's
            look at something simpler than drawing a circle and see what we can learn,
            as we look at some simpler examples we'll try to <em>generalize</em> what we learn
            to help us build a more complex function.</p>
  <p>One thing we already know how to do is to write a function to draw a square.
            Now a square doesn't look anything like a circle, but maybe if we look at
            some other simple shapes that will help us.  Just to remind you,
            here is the code for the <c>drawSquare</c> function.</p>
  <program xml:id="l0401" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def drawSquare(t, sz):
    """Make turtle t draw a square of sz."""

    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(sz)
        t.left(90)
        </input>
  </program>
  <p>Although this isn't going to do anything if you click on the run button,
            you could fill in the rest of the code to make it work, right?</p>
  <p>Now, see if you can modify the code for <c>drawSquare</c> to make it draw a
            triangle.  Call this new function <c>drawTriangle</c>  When you finish
            <c>drawTriangle</c> write a third function called <c>drawOctagon</c>.  When you are
            finished follow the link below to the next part of this lesson.</p>
