            <title>Random Numbers</title>
            <p>Before we begin writing code for this lab, we need to introduce one more
                Python module.  The <c>random</c> module allows us to generate random numbers.
                It&#8217;s easy to use:</p>

<listing xml:id="lab01_1">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="lab01_1_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
import random
x = random.randrange(1,10)
print(x)
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
            <p>The <c>randrange</c> function as called in the example above, generates a random
                number from 1 to 9.
                Even though we said 10 the randrange function works just like the <emphasis>range</emphasis>
                function when it comes to starting and stopping points.  Now if you run the
                program over and over again you should see that each time you run it a
                different number is generated.  Random numbers are the basis of all kinds of
                interesting programs we can write, and the <c>randrange</c> function is just one
                of many functions available in the random module.</p>

            <title>Turtle Races</title>
            <p>In this lab we are going to work step by step through the problem of racing
                turtles.  The idea is that we want to create two or more turtles and have
                them race across the screen from left to right. The turtle that goes the
                farthest is the winner.</p>
            <p>There are several different, and equally plausible, solutions to this problem.
                Let&#8217;s look at what needs to be done, and then look at some of the options for
                the solution.  To start, let&#8217;s think about a solution to the simplest form
                of the problem, a race between two turtles. We&#8217;ll look at more complex races
                later.</p>
            <p>When you are faced with a problem like this in computer science it is
                often a good idea to find a solution to a simple problem first and then
                figure out how to make the solution more general.</p>
            <p>Here is a possible sequence of steps that we will need to accomplish:</p>
            <p><ol label="1">
                <li>
                    <p>Import the modules we need</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a screen</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create two turtles</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Move the turtles to their starting positions</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Send them moving across the screen</p>
                </li>
            </ol></p>
            <p>Here is the Python code for the first 4 steps above</p>

<listing xml:id="lab01_2">
    <caption/>
    <program xml:id="lab01_2_editor" interactive="activecode" language="python">
        <input>
import turtle              # 1.  import the modules
import random
wn = turtle.Screen()       # 2.  Create a screen
wn.bgcolor('lightblue')

lance = turtle.Turtle()    # 3.  Create two turtles
andy = turtle.Turtle()
lance.color('red')
andy.color('blue')
lance.shape('turtle')
andy.shape('turtle')

andy.up()                  # 4.  Move the turtles to their starting point
lance.up()
andy.goto(-100,20)
lance.goto(-100,-20)

# your code goes here

wn.exitonclick()
        </input>
    </program>
</listing>
            <p>Now, you have several choices for how to fill in code for step 5. Here are
                some possibilities to try.  Try coding each of the following in the box above
                to see the different kinds of behavior.</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Use a single call to <c>forward</c> for each turtle, using a random number as
                        the distance to move.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a for loop, using a random number for the parameter passed to the
                        range function.  Inside the for loop move one of the turtles forward by
                        some number of units.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Create a single for loop using something like 150 or 200 as the range
                        parameter. Then inside the for loop move each turtle forward using a random
                        number as the parameter to forward.</p>
                </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>So, which of these programs is better?  Which of these programs is most
                correct?  These are excellent questions. Program 1 is certainly the simplest,
                but it isn&#8217;t very satisfying as far as a race is concerned.  Each turtle
                simply moves their distance on their turn.  That is not very satisfying as far
                as a simulated race goes.  Program 2 ends up looking a lot like Program 1
                when you run it.  Program 3 is probably the most &#8216;realistic&#8217; assuming realism
                is very important when we&#8217;re talking about a simulated race of virtual
                turtles.</p>
            <p>You may be thinking why can&#8217;t each turtle just move forward until they cross
                some artificial finish line?  Good question!  We&#8217;ll get to the answer to
                this, and look at the program in a later lesson when we learn about something
                called the <c>while loop</c>.</p>
