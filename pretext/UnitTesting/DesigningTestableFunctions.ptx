    <title>Designing Testable Functions</title>
    <p>
        Now that you know how to write unit tests using the
        <c>assert</c>
        statement, it&#8217;s important for you
            to understand how to write testable functions. Not all functions can be tested.
    </p>
    <p>Consider the following function:</p>
    <pre>def add(x, y):
    """Adds two numbers and displays the sum"""
    print(x + y)</pre>
    <p>How would you write an assert statement to check that this function works? Think about it a moment.
            Would this work?</p>
    <pre>assert add(2, 3) == 5</pre>
    <p>Answer: no. An assert statement cannot verify that what a function displays on the screen is correct.
            It can only check that the contents of variables are correct. This function is not testable.</p>
    <p>
        A
        <alert>testable function</alert>
        is a function that produces a result that can be checked by an assert
            statement. Generally, it does so in one of three ways:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol label="1">
            <li>
                <p>It returns its result</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It stores its result in a global variable</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It modifies the state of an object passed as a parameter</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Functions that display their output using print are not testable functions.</p>
    <p>
        <alert>Check your understanding</alert>
    </p>

    <exercise xml:id="mc_testable_1">
        <statement>

            <p>Is this a testable function?</p>
            <pre>sum = 0
def add(x, y):
    global sum
    sum = x + y</pre>

        </statement>
        <choices>

            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>
                    <p>Yes.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Correct. In a unit test, an assert statement could check the value of sum after a call to add.
                    </feedback>
            </choice>

            <choice>
                <statement>
                    <p>No.</p>
                </statement>
                <feedback>
                    Incorrect. The function stores its result in a global variable, which can be checked by an assert statement.
                    </feedback>
            </choice>
        </choices>

        <title>Design by Contract</title>
        <p>In addition to producing a result that can be checked by an assert statement, a testable function must have a clear
                specification. In order to write unit tests for a function, you must have a precise understanding of what the function
                should do.</p>
        <p>
            A function specification describes what value the function produces, given its parameter values, and is
                generally expressed in the form of a docstring. For example, consider the
            <c>sumnums</c>
            function given earlier in this
                chapter:
        </p>
        <pre>def sumnums(lo, hi):
    """returns the sum of the numbers in the range [lo..hi]

    Precondition: lo &lt;= hi
    """
    ...</pre>
        <p>The docstring is this function&#8217;s specification. Given this specification, you might write a unit test
                that contains the following assert:</p>
        <pre>assert sumnums(1, 3) == 6</pre>
        <p>An alternate way to write the docstring is as follows:</p>
        <pre>def sumnums(lo, hi):
    """computes the sum of a range of numbers

    Precondition: lo &lt;= hi
    Postcondition: returns the sum of the numbers in the range [lo..hi]
    """
    ...</pre>
        <p>This docstring contains three elements: a brief description; a precondition; and a postcondition. We&#8217;ve
                discussed the concept of a precondition earlier in this chapter. The postcondition is new.</p>
        <admonition classes="admonition-postcondition">
            <title>Postcondition</title>
            <p>
                A
                <alert>postcondition</alert>
                states the work the function completed by the function if the precondition is satisfied.
            </p>
        </admonition>
        <p>
            Functions that include a precondition and a postcondition in their docstring embody a software engineering idea called
            <alert>design by contract</alert>
            . The idea is that a function specification forms a contract between the function and the code
                calling the function. If the code calling the function passes parameters that satisfy the function&#8217;s precondition, then
                the function should be expected to produce what it says it will produce. If the parameters do not satisfy the function&#8217;s
                precondition, then the function does not have to produce a valid result. In the design by contract approach, a testable
                function is one where the function&#8217;s postcondition can be verified by an assert statement.
        </p>
        <p>In this example, you can think of the function&#8217;s docstring as promising to calling code: &#8220;If you give me two parameters,
                lo and hi, such that lo is less than or equal to hi, I promise to return the sum of the numbers in the range lo..hi,
                inclusive.&#8221;</p>
        <p>To write a precondition, think about the parameter values that the function is designed to handle, and write a boolean
                expression that expresses what parameter values are valid. For example, consider a function that computes the average weight,
                given a total weight and a number of items:</p>
        <pre>def compute_average(total_weight: float, num_items: float) -&gt; float:
    return total / num_items</pre>
        <p>
            This function will work if num_items is greater than zero, but will fail if num_items is zero. So, an appropriate precondition
                would be
            <c>num_items &gt; 0</c>
            . A complete docstring would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>def compute_average(total_weight: float, num_items: float) -&gt; float:
    """computes the average weight, given `total_weight` of items and `num_items`

    Precondition: num_items &gt; 0
    Postcondition: returns average item weight
    """</pre>
        <p>Sometimes, your precondition will be expressed more loosely, using English. Consider this function which extracts the
                first word from a string containing text:</p>
        <pre>def get_first_word(text: str) -&gt; str:
    """extracts the first word from `text`"""

    space_loc = text.find(' ')
    return text[0:space_loc]</pre>
        <p>This function will produce nonsense if the string doesn&#8217;t contain a space. So, an appropriate precondition might be
                &#8220;text contains 2 or more words separated by spaces&#8221;. The docstring might be:</p>
        <pre>def get_first_word(text: str) -&gt; str:
    """extracts the first word from `text`

    Precondition: `text` contains 2 or more words separated by spaces
    Postcondition: returns the first word in `text`
    """</pre>
        <p>
            Following the design by contract idea and writing function specifications that include preconditions and postconditions
                is an excellent way to design testable functions, because, as we&#8217;ll see in the next section, it makes it possible to
                reason precisely about what the function should do when given various parameter values. Even if you don&#8217;t use
                precondition and postcondition terminology in your docstrings, it helps to
            <em>think</em>
            in those terms.
