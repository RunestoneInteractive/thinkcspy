.. question:: recursion_ex_3

   Modify the recursive tree program using one or all of the following
   ideas:

   -  Modify the thickness of the branches so that as the ``branchLen``
      gets smaller, the line gets thinner.

   -  Modify the color of the branches so that as the ``branchLen`` gets
      very short it is colored like a leaf.

   -  Modify the angle used in turning the turtle so that at each branch
      point the angle is selected at random in some range. For example
      choose the angle between 15 and 45 degrees. Play around to see
      what looks good.

   -  Modify the ``branchLen`` recursively so that instead of always
      subtracting the same amount you subtract a random amount in some
      range.

   If you implement all of the above ideas you will have a very
   realistic looking tree.

.. question:: recursion_ex_4

   Find or invent an algorithm for drawing a fractal mountain. Hint: One
   approach to this uses triangles again.

.. question:: recursion_ex_5

   Write a recursive function to compute the Fibonacci sequence. How
   does the performance of the recursive function compare to that of an
   iterative version?

   .. actex:: ex_rec_5

.. question:: recursion_ex_6

   Implement a solution to the Tower of Hanoi using three stacks to keep
   track of the disks.

   .. actex:: ex_rec_6

.. question:: recursion_ex_7

   Using the turtle graphics module, write a recursive program to
   display a Hilbert curve.

   .. actex:: ex_rec_7

.. question:: recursion_ex_8

   Using the turtle graphics module, write a recursive program to
   display a Koch snowflake.

.. question:: recursion_ex_9

   Write a program to solve the following problem: You have two jugs: a
   4-gallon jug and a 3-gallon jug. Neither of the jugs have markings on
   them. There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water.
   How can you get exactly two gallons of water in the 4-gallon jug?

   .. actex:: ex_rec_9

.. question:: recursion_ex_10

   Generalize the problem above so that the parameters to your solution
   include the sizes of each jug and the final amount of water to be
   left in the larger jug.

   .. actex:: ex_rec_10

.. question:: recursion_ex_11

   Write a program that solves the following problem: Three missionaries
   and three cannibals come to a river and find a boat that holds two
   people. Everyone must get across the river to continue on the
   journey. However, if the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on
   either bank, the missionaries will be eaten. Find a series of
   crossings that will get everyone safely to the other side of the
   river.

.. question:: recursion_ex_12

   Modify the Tower of Hanoi program using turtle graphics to animate
   the movement of the disks. Hint: You can make multiple turtles and
   have them shaped like rectangles.

.. question:: recursion_ex_13

   Pascal’s triangle is a number triangle with numbers arranged in
   staggered rows such that

   .. math::
      a_{nr} = {n! \over{r! (n-r)!}}

   This equation is the equation for a binomial coefficient. You can
   build Pascal’s triangle by adding the two numbers that are diagonally
   above a number in the triangle. An example of Pascal’s triangle is
   shown below.

   ::

                         1
                       1   1
                     1   2   1
                   1   3   3   1
                 1   4   6   4   1

   Write a program that prints out Pascal’s triangle. Your program
   should accept a parameter that tells how many rows of the triangle to
   print.
