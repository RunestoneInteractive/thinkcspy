Yahtzee
=======

*Studios are in-class activities to give you hands-on practice with new concepts. The first half is the Walkthrough, an instructor-led programming problem. The second half is for you to work on individually or in pairs in class.*

*These problems are not graded, and you are not obligated to finish them. Get as far as you can while in class, and use them as an opportunity to play with and solidify new concepts.*

Studio
------

In this studio, we simulate the game of Yahtzee. The program asks the user for
the number of die they roll and the number of times the dice are thrown. The rollDice
function is given to you. You must create the ``sumOfRoll`` function. If you finish that,
you move on to the bonus function, ``yahtzee``.

.. activecode:: yahtzee_studio

    import random
    from test import testEqual

    # The rollDice function simulates the rolling of the dice. It
    # creates a 2 dimensional list: each column is a die and each
    # row is a throw. The function generates random numbers 1-6
    # and puts them in the list.
    def rollDice(num_dice, num_rolls):

        # create a two-dimensional (num_dice by num_rolls) of zeros
        double_list = [[0 for i in range(num_dice)] for j in range(num_rolls)]

        # loop through each row and column, filling it with a random roll
        for roll in range(0, len(double_list)):
          for die in range(0, len(double_list[roll])):
              double_list[roll][die] = (int)(random.random()*6 + 1)

        return double_list


    # This function takes a 2D list (which can be generated by rollDice)
    # and sums the value of all the dice in each row. It returns a 1
    # dimensional list with the sum of each throw.
    # Example:
    # double_list: [[1, 5, 6],[2, 3, 1],[1, 3, 3]]
    # sumOfRoll should return: [12, 6, 7]
    def sumOfRoll(double_list):
        # Your code here


    # Bonus function! Takes a 2D list and returns
    # the number of times a person rolls Yahtzee (all dice have
    # the same value). Hint: you may want to create a helper
    # function that takes individual rows of the list.
    def yahtzee(double_list):
        # Bonus: your code here
        return 0


    # To play, you'd do something like this
    # dice = input("How many dice?")
    # rolls = input("What is the number of rolls?")
    # list = rollDice(dice, rolls)
    # print("Sum of roll:", sumOfRoll(list))

    print("Testing sumOfRoll...")
    testEqual(sumOfRoll([[4, 5, 2],[6,2,1],[4,4,4]]), [11, 9, 12])
    testEqual(sumOfRoll([[3, 4, 6],[2,6,1],[3,4,3]]), [13, 9, 10])
    print("Testing yahtzee...")
    testEqual(yahtzee([[4, 5, 2],[6,2,1],[4,4,4]]), 1)
    testEqual(yahtzee([[3, 4, 6],[2,6,1],[3,4,3]]), 0)
