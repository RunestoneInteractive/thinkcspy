Standard Exceptions
===================

Most of the standard *exceptions* built into Python are listed below.
They are organized into related groups based on the types of issues they deal with.

=====================  ================================================
Language Exceptions    Description
=====================  ================================================
StandardError          Base class for all built-in exceptions except
                       StopIteration and SystemExit.
ImportError	           Raised when an import statement fails.
SyntaxError            Raised when there is an error in Python syntax.
IndentationError       Raised when indentation is not specified properly.
NameError              Raised when an identifier is not found in the local
                       or global namespace.
UnboundLocalError      Raised when trying to access a local variable in a
                       function or method but no value has been assigned to it.
TypeError              Raised when an operation or function is attempted that
                       is invalid for the specified data type.
LookupError            Base class for all lookup errors.
IndexError             Raised when an index is not found in a sequence.
KeyError               Raised when the specified key is not found in the dictionary.
ValueError             Raised when the built-in function for a data type has
                       the valid type of arguments, but the arguments have
                       invalid values specified.
RuntimeError	         Raised when a generated error does not fall into any category.
MemoryError            Raised when a operation runs out of memory.
RecursionError         Raised when the maximum recursion depth has been exceeded.
SystemError            Raised when the interpreter finds an internal problem,
                       but when this error is encountered the Python interpreter
                       does not exit.
=====================  ================================================

=====================  ================================================
Math Exceptions        Description
=====================  ================================================
ArithmeticError	       Base class for all errors that occur for numeric calculation.
                       You know a math error occurred, but you don't know the
                       specific error.
OverflowError          Raised when a calculation exceeds maximum limit for a
                       numeric type.
FloatingPointError     Raised when a floating point calculation fails.
ZeroDivisonError       Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place for
                       all numeric types.
=====================  ================================================

=====================  ================================================
I/O Exceptions         Description
=====================  ================================================
FileNotFoundError      Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesnâ€™t exist.
IOError                Raised when an input/ output operation fails, such as
                       the print statement or the open() function when trying
                       to open a file that does not exist. Also raised for
                       operating system-related errors.
PermissionError        Raised when trying to run an operation without the
                       adequate access rights.
EOFError               Raised when there is no input from either the raw_input()
                       or input() function and the end of file is reached.
KeyboardInterrupt      Raised when the user interrupts program execution,
                       usually by pressing Ctrl+c.
=====================  ================================================

=====================  ================================================
Other Exceptions       Description
=====================  ================================================
Exception              Base class for all exceptions. This catches most
                       exception messages.
StopIteration          Raised when the next() method of an iterator
                       does not point to any object.
AssertionError	       Raised in case of failure of the Assert statement.
SystemExit             Raised when Python interpreter is quit by using the
                       sys.exit() function. If not handled in the code, it
                       causes the interpreter to exit.
OSError                Raises for operating system related errors.
EnvironmentError       Base class for all exceptions that occur outside the
                       Python environment.
AttributeError	       Raised in case of failure of an attribute reference
                       or assignment.
NotImplementedError    Raised when an abstract method that needs to be
                       implemented in an inherited class is not actually implemented.
=====================  ================================================

All exceptions are objects. The classes that define the objects are organized
in a hierarchy, which is shown below. This is important because the parent
class of a set of related exceptions will catch all exception messages for
itself and its child exceptions. For example, an ``ArithmeticError``
exception will catch itself and all ``FloatingPointError``, ``OverflowError``,
and ``ZeroDivisionError`` exceptions.
