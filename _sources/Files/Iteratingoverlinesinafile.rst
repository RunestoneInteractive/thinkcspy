We will now use this file as input in a program that will do some data
processing. In the program, we will **read** each line of the file and
print it with some additional text. Because text files are sequences of
lines of text, we can use the *for* loop to iterate through each line of
the file.

A **line** of a file is defined to be a sequence of characters up to and
including a special character called the **newline** character. If you
evaluate a string that contains a newline character you will see the
character represented as ``\n``. If you print a string that contains a
newline you will not see the ``\n``, you will just see its effects. When
you are typing a Python program and you press the enter or return key on
your keyboard, the editor inserts a newline character into your text at
that point.

As the *for* loop iterates through each line of the file the loop
variable will contain the current line of the file as a string of
characters. The general pattern for processing each line of a text file
is as follows:

::

        for line in myFile:
            statement1
            statement2
            ...

To process all of our quarterback data, we will use a *for* loop to iterate over the lines of the file. Using
the ``split`` method, we can break each line into a list containing all the fields of interest about the
quarterback. We can then take the values corresponding to first name, lastname, and passer rating to
construct a simple sentence.




.. activecode:: files_for
    :nocodelens:
    :available_files: qbdata.txt

    qbfile = open("qbdata.txt", "r")

    for aline in qbfile:
        values = aline.split()
        print('QB ', values[0], values[1], 'had a rating of ', values[10] )

    qbfile.close()


.. note::
   You can obtain a line from the keyboard with the ``input`` function, and you can process lines of a file.  
   However "line" is used differently:  With ``input`` Python reads through the newline you enter from the keyboard,
   but the newline (``'\n'``) is *not* included in the line returned by ``input``. It is dropped. 
   When a line is taken from a file, the terminating newline *is* included as the last character (unless you
   are reading the final line of a file that happens to not have a newline at the end).

In the quarterback example it is irrelevant whether the final line has a newline character at the end or not, 
since it would be stripped off by the ``split`` method call.
