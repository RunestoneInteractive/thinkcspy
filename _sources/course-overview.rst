Course Overview
================

Read this page for details on how this course works, what you must do to pass the course, how to submit your work, and how to get help.

Class Rhythm
------------

In this course, there are two settings in which you will learn and work on stuff:

* **Before Class:** Before each class period, you should read the next chapter from the book, and work on the associated exercises.
* **During Class:** During class time, we will go over the material you read, and work on practice problems in small groups.

Before Class
    * **Read:** Each chapter in the book contains a handful of pages you should read. The readings are interspersed with interactive components such as active code examples with which you can tinker and explore, and multiple-choice questions so you can self-check your understanding.
    * **Attempt Exercises:** At the end of each chapter is a page containing a handful of exercises for you to practice. Some are easy, others are hard. You will probably spend the majority of your time working on these exercises. You do not have to complete them all, but you must attempt at least 5 for each chapter. You are encouraged to to more, and to try to get them correct, but the minimum is that you attempt at least 5.

During Class
    * **Review:** In class, we will review the material from the chapter you read, with live examples and question-and-answer sessions. 
    * **Studios:** You will sometimes be asked to work together in small groups on another practice exercise called a "Studio".


See the `Course Schedule`_ for a week-by-week breakdown.


Requirements 
------------

This course is Pass/Fail. There are two levels of certification:

* **Pass with Honors:** For students who complete all of the work on time.
* **Pass:** For students who complete all of the work, mostly on time (more details below).

Evaluation 
    In order to pass the course, you will be evaulated on three different criteria:

    * Participation
    * Weekly Graded Assignments
    * Final Problem Set

Participation
    Participaton simply means that you are keeping up with the pace of the class and doing the required work: reading all the chapters, attempting 5 or more exercises for each chapter, attending class, and working on studios in class.

Weekly Graded Assignments
    As mentioned, each chapter contains a page with exercises that you should work on. Ususally, one of those exercises will be specially marked as "GRADED", meaning that you must submit your code (and it must actually work, performing correctly under a set of automated tests). See below for more details on submitting assignments.

Final Problem Set
    Towards the end of class, you will complete and turn in a larger programming assignment, which will also be graded by automated tests. 

Deadlines
* **Weekly Assignments** must be submitted by end-of-day on Sunday of the week they are assigned.

* **The Problem Set** must be submitted before the final day of class.

* Lateness Policy
    In order to pass the class you must complete all the work, but you may submit up to two late Weekly Assignments, and you may miss a few class sessions.
    

Submitting Assignments
----------------------

We will be using Vocareum for homework submission. On Vocareum, you will see a list of Assignments with names like *Weekly Assignment: Chapter 3*. When you click on the assignment you will see more detailed instructions. 


Getting help
------------

During class, mentors will circulate and provide help while you are working.

Outside of class, we use a discussion board forum called Piazza, which you can use to ask questions.
