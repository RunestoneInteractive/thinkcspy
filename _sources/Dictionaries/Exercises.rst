               Write a program that allows the user to enter a string.  It then prints a
               table of the letters of the alphabet in alphabetical order which occur in
               the string together with the number of times each letter occurs. Case should
               be ignored. A sample run of the program might look this this::   
               
                   Please enter a sentence: ThiS is String with Upper and lower case Letters.

       Give the Python interpreter's response to each of the following from a
       continuous interpreter session:
    
       a.
          .. sourcecode:: python
    
              >>> d = {'apples': 15, 'bananas': 35, 'grapes': 12}

              Write a program called ``alice_words.py`` that creates a text file named
              ``alice_words.txt`` containing an alphabetical listing of all the words, and the
              number of times each occurs, in the text version of `Alice's Adventures in Wonderland`.
              (You can obtain a free plain text version of the book, along with many others, from
              http://www.gutenberg.org.) The first 10 lines of your output file should look
              something like this
   
               =========== ===========
               Word              Count
