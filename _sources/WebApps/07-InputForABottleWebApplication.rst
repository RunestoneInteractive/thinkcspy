Input For A Bottle Web Application 
----------------------------------

In this section, we will design a web application that obtains input from
the user. In the example in this section, the user must encode the input directly
into the URL. In the next section, we'll provide a more user-friendly approach
for obtaining input.

The URL used to interact with a web application can contain input data in addition to the
path. This input data is typically encoded into the URL in the form of a query string.
Here's an example of a URL containing a query string:

    http://www.bing.com/search?q=python&go=Submit

The query string is the portion that comes after the ? symbol::

    q=python&go=Submit

It contains a set of query variables and values, each query variable/value pair separated 
from the others by the & symbol. This example has a query variable named ``q`` whose value is
*python+bottle*, and a variable named ``go`` whose value is *Submit*.

Bottle applications can access query variables using a dictionary named
``bottle.request.params`` (dictionaries are discussed in detail in 
:doc:`../Dictionaries/intro-Dictionaries`). 
When a browser sends a request to a Bottle application that contains
a query string, the data in the query string is placed in the ``bottle.request.params``
dictionary, where it can be retrieved by the application. For example, in the Bing search
URL above, if Bing were a Bottle application, it could access the values in the query string 
like this::

    q = bottle.request.params['q']
    go = bottle.request.params['go']
    
This would retrieve the values 'bottle' and 'Submit' from the query string and store them,
respectively, in ``q`` and ``go``.

Here is an enhanced version of the original bottlehello.py program that gets the user's name
from the query string and uses it to greet the user:

.. sourcecode:: python
   :linenos:

    import bottle
    from datetime import datetime

    @bottle.route('/')
    def hello():
        name = bottle.request.params['name']
        return """
            <html><body>
                <h1>Hello, {0}!</h1>
                The time is {1}.
            </body></html>
            """.format(
                name, str(datetime.now()))

    # Launch the BottlePy dev server 
    bottle.run(host='localhost', debug=True)

To test this example, you would need to enter the following URL into the browser:

    http://localhost:8080/?name=Frank
    
If the name parameter is omitted, the application will crash when it attempts to
retrieve the query parameter from the dictionary, because indexing a dictionary
with a key that is not present in the dictionary is illegal. 
To make the application more robust, we could change line 6 to 
check to see if the name parameter was submitted::

    if 'name' in bottle.request.params:
        name = bottle.request.params['name']
    else:
        name = 'World'

The test ``'name' in bottle.request.params`` is True if 'name'
was present in the query parameters, and False if not.

A shorter way to handle a missing query parameter is to change line 6 to use the
dictionary ``get()`` method, which allows us to supply a default value to use in
case the user omits the query parameter::

    name = bottle.request.params.get('name', 'World')

This line does the same check as the if statement, and stores the value
'World' in ``name`` if no name parameter was supplied.
